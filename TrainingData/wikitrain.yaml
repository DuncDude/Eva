- - how a vul works
  - Variable Universal Life Insurance often shortened to VUL is a type of life insurance that builds a cash valueIn a VUL the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts  similar to mutual funds  and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract ownerThe variable component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values varythey vary because they are invested in stock andor bond marketsThe universal component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium paymentsThe premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the Internal Revenue Code for life insuranceThis flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy although one may exercise an Automatic Premium Loan feature or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premiumVariable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance  because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policyWith most if not all VULs unlike whole life there is no endowment age the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount which for whole life is typically 100This is yet another key advantage of VUL over Whole LifeWith a typical whole life policy the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy and at endowment age the face amount is all that is paid outThus with either death or endowment the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the yearsHowever some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase paid up additions to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over timeIf investments made in the separate accounts outperform the general account of the insurance company a higher rateofreturn can occur than the fixed ratesofreturn typical for whole lifeThe combination over the years of no endowment age continually increasing death benefit and if a high rateofreturn is earned in the separate accounts of a VUL policy this could result in higher value to the owner or beneficiary than that of a whole life policy with the same amounts of money paid in as premiums

  - Flat roofs in IsraelFlat roof in Los AngelesA flat roof is a type of covering for a building In contrast to the more sloped form of roof  a flat roof is horizontal or nearly horizontalThe slope of a roof is properly known as its pitch Roofs which are nearly flat are known as lowpitch roofs as the angle of slope increases so the pitch is said to increaseAny sheet of material used to cover a flat or lowpitched roof is usually known as a membrane and the primary purpose of these membranes is to waterproof the roof areaMaterials that cover flat roofs typically allow the water to run off from a slight inclination or camber into a gutter systemWater from some flat roofs such as on garden sheds sometimes flows freely off the edge of a roof though gutter systems are of advantage in keeping both walls and foundations dryGutters on smaller roofs often lead water directly onto the ground or better into a specially made soakawayGutters on larger roofs usually lead water into the rainwater drainage system of any built up areaOccasionally flat roofs though are designed to collect water in a pool usually for aesthetic purposes or for rainwater bufferingFlat roofs exist all over the world and each area has its own tradition or preference for materials usedIn warmer climes where rainfall is less and freezing is unlikely to occur many flat roofs are simply built of masonry or concrete and this is good at keeping out the heat of the sun and cheap and easy to build where timber is not readily availableIn areas where the roof could become saturated by rain and leak or where water soaked into the brickwork could freeze to ice and thus lead to blowing breaking up of the mortarbrickworkconcrete by the expansion of ice as it forms these roofs are not suitableTraditionally most flat roofs in the western world make use of tar or more usually tar paper applied over roof decking to keep a building watertightThe tar or tarpaper is in turn covered in gravel to keep the suns heat UV rays and weather off it and helps protect it from cracking or blistering and degradationRoof decking is usually of plywood chipboard or OSB boards OSB  Oriented Strand Board  also known as Sterling board  of around 18mm thicknessThe tar coating is applied in one or more coats as a hot liquid heated in a tar kettle  or as sheets of tar impregnated paper glued down and sealed together at joints by hot tar  once it has cooled the gravel is spread evenly over itA main reason for failure of these traditional roofs is ignorance or lack of maintenance where people or events cause the gravel to be moved or removed from the tar or tarpaper waterproofing thus exposing it to weather and sun whereupon cracking and blistering occurs over time and eventually water gets inTarpaper is usually a paper or fibre material soaked or impregnated in tarAs gravel cannot protect tarpaper surfaces where they rise vertically from the roof such as on parapet walls or upstands tarpaper variants are produced with fine gravel applied to the hot tar during the process of manufacture such that a permanent layer of gravel is stuck to it in order to give it ongoing protectionTarpapers vary in quality as does the workmanship and training of those applying it to produce more or less successful resultsIn some micro climates or shaded areas these rather basic tarpaper roofs can last well in relation to the cost of materials purchase and cost of laying them however the cost of modern membranes such as EPDM has come down over recent years to make them more and more affordableThere are now more firms supplying modern alternatives and there is generally a growing awareness of their performance and availabilityIf a leak does occur on a flat roof then damage often goes unnoticed for long periods of time during which water penetrates and soaks the decking and any insulation andor structure beneath itThis can lead to expensive damage from the rot which often develops and if left can weaken the roof structureThere are also various health risks to people and animals breathing the mould spores the severity of this health risk remains a debated pointOne problem with maintaining flat roofs is that if water does penetrate the barrier covering be it traditional or a modern membrane it can travel a long way before causing visible damage or leaking into a building where it can be seenThus it is not easy to see where it is leaking in order to repair itOnce underlying roof decking is soaked it often sags causing a further collection or puddling of water in that area and the problem worsens

- - how are tropical storms and hurricanes named
  - Hurricane Isabel 2003 as seen from orbit during Expedition 7 of the International Space Station The eye  eyewall and surrounding rainbands  characteristics of tropical cyclones are clearly visible in this view from spaceA tropical cyclone is a storm system characterized by a lowpressure center surrounded by a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce strong winds and heavy rainTropical cyclones strengthen when water evaporated from the ocean is released as the saturated air rises resulting in condensation of water vapor contained in the moist airThey are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as noreasters  European windstorms  and polar lows The characteristic that separates tropical cyclones from other cyclonic systems is that at any height in the atmosphere the center of a tropical cyclone will be warmer than its surroundings a phenomenon called  warm core  storm systemsThe term tropical refers both to the geographical origin of these systems which usually form in tropical regions of the globe and to their formation in maritime tropical air masses The term cyclone refers to such storms cyclonic nature with counterclockwise wind flow in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise wind flow in the Southern Hemisphere The opposite direction of the wind flow is a result of the Coriolis force Depending on its location and strength a tropical cyclone is referred to by names such as hurricane   typhoon  tropical storm  cyclonic storm tropical depression  and simply cycloneWhile tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential rain  they are also able to produce high waves damaging storm surge  and tornadoes They develop over large bodies of warm water and lose their strength if they move over land due to increased surface friction and loss of the warm ocean as an energy sourceThis is why coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone while inland regions are relatively safe from receiving strong windsHeavy rains however can produce significant flooding inland and storm surges can produce extensive coastal flooding up to from the coastlineAlthough their effects on human populations can be devastating tropical cyclones can relieve drought conditionsThey also carry heat energy away from the tropics and transport it toward temperate latitudes  which makes them an important part of the global atmospheric circulation mechanismAs a result tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the Earths troposphere  and to maintain a relatively stable and warm temperature worldwideMany tropical cyclones develop when the atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance in the atmosphere are favorableThe background environment is modulated by climatological cycles and patterns such as the MaddenJulian oscillation  El NioSouthern Oscillation  and the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristicsTropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere  if the conditions remain favorable the tropical disturbance intensifies and can even develop an eye On the other end of the spectrum if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall the system weakens and eventually dissipatesIt is not possible to artificially induce the dissipation of these systems with current technology

  - White light is dispersed by a prism into the colors of the optical spectrumThe visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to can be detected by the human eye Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 390 to 700 nm In terms of frequency this corresponds to a band in the vicinity of 430790 THz A lightadapted eye generally has its maximum sensitivity at around 555 nm 540 THz in the green region of the optical spectrum see luminosity function The spectrum does not however contain all the colors that the human eyes and brain can distinguishUnsaturated colors such as pink  or purple variations such as magenta  are absent for example because they can be made only by a mix of multiple wavelengthsColors containing only one wavelength are also called pure colors Visible wavelengths pass through the  optical window  the region of the electromagnetic spectrum which allows wavelengths to pass largely unattenuated through the Earths atmosphere An example of this phenomenon is that clean air scatters blue light more than red wavelengths and so the midday sky appears blueThe optical window is also called the visible window because it overlaps the human visible response spectrumThe near infrared NIR window lies just out of the human vision as well as the Medium Wavelength IR MWIR window and the Long Wavelength or Far Infrared LWIR or FIR window though other animals may experience themMany species can see light with frequencies outside the visible spectrum which is defined in terms of human visionBees and many other insects can detect ultraviolet light which helps them find nectar in flowersPlant species that depend on insect pollination may owe reproductive success to their appearance in ultraviolet light rather than how colorful they appear to humansBirds too can see into the ultraviolet 300400 nm and some have sexdependent markings on their plumage that are visible only in the ultraviolet rangeMany animals that can see into the ultraviolet range however cannot see red light or any other reddish wavelengthsBees visible spectrum ends at about 590nm just before the orange wavelengths startBirds however can see some red wavelengths but not as many as humans

- - how are the  of electrons in each shell determined
  - Periodic table with electron shellsAn electron shell may be thought of as an orbit followed by electrons around an atom s nucleus The closest shell to the nucleus is called the 1 shell also called K shell followed by the 2 shell or L shell then the 3 shell or M shell and so on farther and farther from the nucleusThe shell letters K L M  used in the Xray notation  are alphabeticalEach shell can contain only a fixed number of electrons The 1st shell can hold up to two electrons the 2nd shell can hold up to eight electrons the 3rd shell can hold up to 18 and 4th shell can hold up to 32 and so onSince electrons are electrically attracted to the nucleus an atoms electrons will generally occupy outer shells only if the more inner shells have already been completely filled by other electronsHowever this is not a strict requirement Atoms may have two or even three incomplete outer shellsSee Madelung rule for more detailsFor an explanation of why electrons exist in these shells see electron configuration The electrons in the outermost occupied shell or shells determine the chemical properties of the atom it is called the valence shellEach shell consists of one or more subshells and each subshell consists of one or more atomic orbitals

- - how are ribosomes made
  - The ribosome assembles polymeric protein molecules whose sequence is controlled by the sequence of messenger RNA moleculesThis is required by all living cells and associated virusesThe ribosome from ribonucleic acid and the Greek soma meaning body is a large and complex molecular machine found within all living cells that serves as the primary site of biological protein synthesis translationRibosomes link amino acids together in the order specified by messenger RNA mRNA moleculesRibosomes consist of two major subunitsthe small ribosomal subunit reads the mRNA while the large subunit joins amino acids to form a polypeptide chainEach subunit is composed of one or more ribosomal RNA rRNA molecules and a variety of proteinsThe sequence of DNA encoding for a protein may be copied many times into messenger RNA mRNA chains of a similar sequenceRibosomes can bind to an mRNA chain and use it as a template for determining the correct sequence of amino acids in a particular proteinAmino acids are selected collected and carried to the ribosome by transfer RNA tRNA molecules which enter one part of the ribosome and bind to the messenger RNA chainThe attached amino acids are then linked together by another part of the ribosomeOnce the protein is produced it can then fold to produce a specific functional threedimensional structureA ribosome is made from complexes of RNAs and proteins and is therefore a ribonucleoprotein Each ribosome is divided into two subunits the smaller subunit binds to the mRNA pattern while the larger subunit binds to the tRNA and the amino acidsWhen a ribosome finishes reading an mRNA molecule these two subunits split apartRibosomes are ribozymes  because the catalytic peptidyl transferase activity that links amino acids together is performed by the ribosomal RNA Ribosomes from bacteria  archaea and eukaryotes the three domains of life on Earth  differ in their size sequence structure and the ratio of protein to RNAThe differences in structure allow some antibiotics to kill bacteria by inhibiting their ribosomes while leaving human ribosomes unaffectedIn bacteria and archaea more than one ribosome may move along a single mRNA chain at one time each reading its sequence and producing a corresponding protein moleculeThe ribosomes in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells functionally resemble many features of those in bacteria reflecting the likely evolutionary origin of mitochondriaAlbert Claude  Christian de Duve  and George Emil Palade were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine  in 1974 for the discovery of the ribosomesThe Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009 was awarded to Venkatraman Ramakrishnan  Thomas A Steitz and Ada E Yonath for determining the detailed structure and mechanism of the ribosome

  - A financial audit or more accurately an audit of financial statements is the verification of the financial statements of a legal entity  with a view to express an audit opinionThe audit opinion is intended to provide reasonable assurance but not absolute assurance that the financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects andor give a true and fair view in accordance with the financial reporting frameworkThe purpose of an audit is provide and objective independent examination of the financial statements which increases the value and credibility of the financial statements produced by management thus increase user confidence in the financial statement reduce investor risk and consequently reduce the cost of capital of the preparer of the financial statementsFinancial audits are typically performed by firms of practicing accountants who are experts in financial reportingThe financial audit is one of many assurance functions provided by accounting firmsMany organizations separately employ or hire internal auditors  who do not attest to financial reports but focus mainly on the internal controls of the organizationExternal auditors may choose to place limited reliance on the work of internal auditorsAuditing promotes transparency and accuracy in the financial disclosures made by an organization therefore would likely to reduce of such corporations to conceal unscrupulous dealingsInternationally the International Standards on Auditing ISA issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board IAASB is considered as the benchmark for audit processAlmost all jurisdictions require auditors to follow the ISA or a local variation of the ISA

  - In straight and level flight lift L equals weight WIn a banked turn of 60 lift equals double the weight L2WThe pilot experiences 2g and a doubled weightThe steeper the bank the greater the gforcesThis topfuel dragster can accelerate from zero to in 086 secondsThis is a horizontal acceleration of 53 g Combined with the vertical gforce in the stationary case the Pythagorean theorem yields a g force of 54 ggforce with g from gravitational is a term for accelerations felt as weight and measurable by accelerometers It is not a force per se but a force per unit massSince such a force is perceived as a weight any gforce can be described as a weight per unit mass see the synonym specific weight The gforce acceleration acts as a multiplier of weightlike forces for every unit of an objects mass and save for certain electromagnetic force influences is the cause of an objects acceleration in relation to freefall This acceleration experienced by an object is due to the vector sum of nongravitational forces acting on an object free to moveThe accelerations that are not produced by gravity are termed proper accelerations  and it is only these that are measured in gforce unitsThey cause stresses and strains on objectsBecause of these strains large gforces may be destructiveGravitation acting alone does not produce a gforce even though gforces are expressed in multiples of the acceleration of a standard gravityThus the standard gravitational acceleration at the Earths surface produces gforce only indirectly as a result of resistance to it by mechanical forcesThe 1 gforce on an object sitting on the Earths surface is caused by mechanical force exerted in the upward direction by the ground  keeping the object from going into freefallThe upward force from the ground ensures that an object at rest on the Earths surface is accelerating relative to the freefall condition which is the path that the object would follow when falling freely toward the Earths centerObjects allowed to freefall in an inertial trajectory under the influence of gravitationonly feel no gforceThis is demonstrated by the zerog conditions inside a freely falling elevator falling toward the Earths center in vacuum or to good approximation conditions inside a spacecraft in Earth orbitThese are examples of coordinate acceleration a change in velocity without a sensation of weightThe experience of no gforce zerog however it is produced is synonymous with weightlessness In the absence of gravitational fields or in directions at right angles to them proper and coordinate accelerations are the same and any coordinate acceleration must be produced by a corresponding gforce accelerationAn example here is a rocket in free space in which simple changes in velocity are produced by the engines and produce gforces on the rocket and passengers

- - What generates gamma radiation
  - A diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum showing various properties across the range of frequencies and wavelengthsThe electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation The electromagnetic spectrum of an object has a different meaning and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular objectThe electromagnetic spectrum extends from below the low frequencies used for modern radio communication to gamma radiation at the short wavelength highfrequency end thereby covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an atom The limit for long wavelengths is the size of the universe itself while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the Planck length  although in principle the spectrum is infinite and continuous Most parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are used in science for spectroscopic and other probing interactions as ways to study and characterize matterIn addition radiation from various parts of the spectrum has found many other uses for communications and manufacturing see electromagnetic radiation for more applicationsLegend

- - what is feedback mechanism in plants during respiration
  - Typical eukaryotic cell Cellular respiration is the set of the metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate ATP and then release waste productsThe reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions  which break large molecules into smaller ones releasing energy in the process as weak socalled highenergy bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the productsRespiration is one of the key ways a cell gains useful energy to fuel cellular activityCellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction The overall reaction is broken into many smaller ones when it occurs in the body most of which are redox reactions themselvesAlthough technically cellular respiration is a combustion reaction  it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cellThis difference is because it occurs in many separate stepsWhile the overall reaction is a combustion reaction no single reaction that comprises it is a combustion reactionNutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar  amino acids and fatty acids  and a common oxidizing agent  electron acceptor  is molecular oxygen O2The energy stored in ATP its third phosphate group is weakly bonded to the rest of the molecule and is cheaply broken allowing stronger bonds to form thereby transferring energy for use by the cell can then be used to drive processes requiring energy including biosynthesis  locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes

- - what does metes and bounds mean
  - Metes and bounds is a system or method of describing land real property in contrast to personal property or real estate The system has been used in England for many centuries and is still used there in the definition of general boundariesBy custom it was applied in the original Thirteen Colonies that became the United States  and in many other land jurisdictions based on English common law Typically the system uses physical features of the local geography  along with directions and distances to define and describe the boundaries of a parcel of landThe boundaries are described in a running prose style working around the parcel in sequence from a point of beginning  returning back to the same point compare with the oral ritual of beating the bounds It may include references to other adjoining parcels and their owners and it in turn could also be referred to in later surveysAt the time the description is compiled it may have been marked on the ground with permanent monuments placed where there were no suitable natural monumentsThe term metes refers to a boundary defined by the measurement of each straight run specified by a distance between the terminal points and an orientation or directionA direction may be a simple compass bearing or a precise orientation determined by accurate survey methodsThe term bounds refers to a more general boundary description such as along a certain watercourse a stone wall an adjoining public road way or an existing buildingThe system is often used to define larger pieces of property eg farms and political subdivisions eg town boundaries where precise definition is not required or would be far too expensive or previously designated boundaries can be incorporated into the description
- - what did isaac newton do
  - Sir Isaac Newton 25 December 164220 March 1727 was an English physicist and mathematician who is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time and as a key figure in the scientific revolution His book Philosophi Naturalis Principia Mathematica Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy first published in 1687 laid the foundations for most of classical mechanics Newton also made seminal contributions to optics and shares credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the invention of the infinitesimal calculus Newtons Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that dominated scientists view of the physical universe for the next three centuriesIt also demonstrated that the motion of objects on the Earth and that of celestial bodies could be described by the same principlesBy deriving Keplers laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the cosmosNewton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into the many colours of the visible spectrum He also formulated an empirical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound In addition to his work on the calculus as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series  generalised the binomial theorem to noninteger exponents and developed Newtons method for approximating the roots of a function Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge He was a devout but unorthodox Christian and unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty he refused to take holy orders in the Church of England  perhaps because he privately rejected the doctrine of trinitarianism In addition to his work on the mathematical sciences Newton also dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology  but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his deathIn his later life Newton became president of the Royal Society He also served the British government as Warden and Master of the Royal Mint 
- - what does the universal law of gravitation state
  - Prof Walter Lewin explains Newtons law of gravitation in MIT course 801Satellites and projectiles all obey Newtons law of gravitationNewtons law of universal gravitation states that every point mass in the universe attracts every other point mass with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between themSeparately it was shown that large spherically symmetrical masses attract and are attracted as if all their mass were concentrated at their centers This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Newton called induction It is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in Newtons work Philosophi Naturalis Principia Mathematica the Principia first published on 5 July 1687When Newtons book was presented in 1686 to the Royal Society  Robert Hooke made a claim that Newton had obtained the inverse square law from him  see History section belowIn modern language the law states the followingAssuming SI units  F is measured in newtons N m1 and m2 in kilograms kg r in meters m and the constant G is approximately equal to The value of the constant G was first accurately determined from the results of the Cavendish experiment conducted by the British scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798 although Cavendish did not himself calculate a numerical value for GThis experiment was also the first test of Newtons theory of gravitation between masses in the laboratoryIt took place 111 years after the publication of Newtons Principia and 71 years after Newtons death so none of Newtons calculations could use the value of G instead he could only calculate a force relative to another forceNewtons law of gravitation resembles Coulombs law of electrical forces which is used to calculate the magnitude of electrical force between two charged bodiesBoth are inversesquare laws  in which force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bodiesCoulombs Law has the product of two charges in place of the product of the masses and the electrostatic constant in place of the gravitational constantNewtons law has since been superseded by Einsteins theory of general relativity  but it continues to be used as an excellent approximation of the effects of gravityRelativity is required only when there is a need for extreme precision or when dealing with gravitation for extremely massive and dense objects

- - How Hydrogen Fuel For Cars Work
  - Honda FCX Clarity  a hydrogen fuel cell demonstration vehicle introduced in 2008A hydrogen vehicle is a vehicle that uses hydrogen as its onboard fuel for motive powerHydrogen vehicles include hydrogen fueled space rockets  as well as automobiles and other transportation vehiclesThe power plants of such vehicles convert the chemical energy of hydrogen to mechanical energy either by burning hydrogen in an internal combustion engine  or by reacting hydrogen with oxygen in a fuel cell to run electric motorsWidespread use of hydrogen for fueling transportation is a key element of a proposed hydrogen economy Hydrogen fuel does not occur naturally on Earth and thus is not an energy source rather it is an energy carrierIt is most frequently made from methane or other fossil fuels  but it can be produced using sources such as wind solar or nuclear that are intermittent too diffuse or too cumbersome to directly propel vehiclesIntegrated windtohydrogen plants using electrolysis of water  are exploring technologies to deliver costs low enough and quantities great enough to compete with traditional energy sourcesMany companies are working to develop technologies that might efficiently exploit the potential of hydrogen energy for mobile usesThe attraction of using hydrogen as an energy currency is that if hydrogen is prepared without using fossil fuel inputs vehicle propulsion would not contribute to carbon dioxide emissionsThe drawbacks of hydrogen use are high capital cost low energy content per unit volume high tankage weights very high storage vessel pressures the storage transportation and filling of gaseous or liquid hydrogen in vehicles the large investment in infrastructure that would be required to fuel vehicles and the inefficiency of production processes

- - how was the moon formed
  - Hubble views of Copernicus crater inset which is about 58 miles 93 km wideRed and orange tinted Moon as seen from Earth during a lunar eclipse where the Earth comes between the Moon and SunThe Moon is the only natural satellite of the Earth  and the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System It is the largest natural satellite of a planet in the Solar System relative to the size of its primary  having 27 the diameter and 60 the density of Earth resulting in its mass The Moon is the second densest satellite after Io  a satellite of JupiterThe Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth always showing the same face with its near side marked by dark volcanic maria that fill between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the prominent impact craters It is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun  although its surface is actually very dark with a reflectance similar to that of coalIts prominence in the sky and its regular cycle of phases have since ancient times made the Moon an important cultural influence on language  calendars  art and mythology The Moons gravitational influence produces the ocean tides and the minute lengthening of the dayThe Moons current orbital distance about thirty times the diameter of the Earth causes it to appear almost the same size in the sky as the Sun allowing it to cover the Sun nearly precisely in total solar eclipses This matching of apparent visual size is a coincidenceThe Moons linear distance from the Earth is currently increasing at a rate of 382007cm per year but this rate is not constantThe Moon is thought to have formed nearly 45 billion years ago not long after the EarthAlthough there have been several hypotheses for its origin in the past the current most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars sized bodyThe Moon is the only celestial body other than Earth on which humans have set foot The Soviet Union s Luna programme was the first to reach the Moon with unmanned spacecraft in 1959 the United States NASA Apollo program achieved the only manned missions to date beginning with the first manned lunar orbiting mission by Apollo 8 in 1968 and six manned lunar landings between 1969 and 1972 with the first being Apollo 11 These missions returned over 380 kg of lunar rocks  which have been used to develop a geological understanding of the Moons origins the formation of its internal structure  and its subsequent history After the Apollo 17 mission in 1972 the Moon has been visited only by unmanned spacecraft notably by the final Soviet Lunokhod rover Since 2004 Japan China India the United States and the European Space Agency have each sent lunar orbitersThese spacecraft have contributed to confirming the discovery of lunar water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles and bound into the lunar regolith Future manned missions to the Moon have been planned including government as well as privately funded effortsThe Moon remains under the Outer Space Treaty  free to all nations to explore for peaceful purposes

- - what antibodies are produced in large quantities
  - Each antibody binds to a specific antigen  an interaction similar to a lock and keyAn antibody Ab also known as an immunoglobulin Ig is a large Yshaped protein produced by Bcells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses The antibody recognizes a unique part of the foreign target called an antigen Each tip of the Y of an antibody contains a paratope a structure analogous to a lock that is specific for one particular epitope similarly analogous to a key on an antigen allowing these two structures to bind together with precisionUsing this binding mechanism an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system or can neutralize its target directly for example by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survivalThe production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system Antibodies are secreted by a type of white blood cell called a plasma cell Antibodies can occur in two physical forms a soluble form that is secreted from the cell and a membrane bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B cell receptor BCRThe BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells  or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposureIn most cases interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and therefore antibody generation following antigen bindingSoluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganismsAntibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily  the terms antibody and immunoglobulin are often used interchangeablyAntibodies are typically made of basic structural unitseach with two large heavy chains and two small light chains There are several different types of antibody heavy chains and several different kinds of antibodies which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possessFive different antibody isotypes are known in mammals which perform different roles and help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounterThough the general structure of all antibodies is very similar a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures or antigen binding sites to existThis region is known as the hypervariable regionEach of these variants can bind to a different antigenThis enormous diversity of antibodies allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigensThe large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites or paratopes followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene which create further diversityAntibody genes also reorganize in a process called class switching that changes the base of the heavy chain to another creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable regionThis allows a single antibody to be used by several different parts of the immune system

- - how does nanotechnology affect health
  - Nanotechnology sometimes shortened to nanotech is the manipulation of matter on an atomic and molecular scaleThe earliest widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative  which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantumrealm scale and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size thresholdIt is therefore common to see the plural form nanotechnologies as well as nanoscale technologies to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is sizeBecause of the variety of potential applications including industrial and military governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology researchThrough its National Nanotechnology Initiative the USA has invested 37 billion dollarsThe European Union has invested 12 billion and Japan 750 million dollarsNanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad including fields of science as diverse as surface science  organic chemistry  molecular biology  semiconductor physics  microfabrication  etcThe associated research and applications are equally diverse ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular selfassembly  from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale Scientists currently debate the future implications of nanotechnology Nanotechnology may be able to create many new materials and devices with a vast range of applications  such as in medicine  electronics  biomaterials and energy productionOn the other hand nanotechnology raises many of the same issues as any new technology including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials and their potential effects on global economics as well as speculation about various doomsday scenarios These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted

- - how much water is the human body made of
  - In physiology  body water is the water content of the human body A significant fraction of the human body is waterArthur Guyton s Textbook of Medical Physiology states that the total amount of water in a man of average weight 70 kilograms is approximately 40 litres averaging 57 percent of his total body weightIn a newborn infant this may be as high as 75 percent of the body weight but it progressively decreases from birth to old age most of the decrease occurring during the first 10 years of lifeAlso obesity decreases the percentage of water in the body sometimes to as low as 45 percentThese figures are statistical averages so are illustrative and like all biostatistics will vary with things like type of population age and number of people sampled and methodologySo there is not and cannot be a figure that is exactly the same for all people for this or any other physiological measureFor example Jacksons 1985 Anatomy  Physiology for Nurses gives a figure of 60 for the proportion of bodyweight attributable to water which approximates Guytons 57In diseased states where body water is affected the compartment or compartments that have changed can give clues to the nature of the problemBody water is regulated by hormones  including antidiuretic hormone ADH aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide Per Netters Atlas of Human Physiology body water is broken down into the following compartmentsIntracellular fluid 23 of body waterPer Guyton in a body containing 40 litres of fluid about 25 litres is intracellular which amounts to 625 58 close enough to the 23 rule of thumbJacksons texts states 70 of body fluid is intracellularExtracellular fluid 13 of body waterPer Guytons illustration for a 40 litre body about 15 litres is extracellular which amounts to 375 Again this is close to the 13 rule of thumb cited herePlasma 15 of extracellular fluidPer Guytons illustration of the 15 litres of extracellular fluid plasma volume averages 3 litresThis amounts to 20 the same as per Netters AtlasInterstitial fluid 45 of extracellular fluidTranscellular fluid aka third space normally ignored in calculationsContained inside organs such as the gastrointestinal  cerebrospinal  peritoneal and ocular fluids

- - how frequent do you inspect hydrants
  - Fire hydrant in Charlottesville Virginia USAA fire hydrant also known colloquially as a fire plug in the United States or as a johnny pump in New York City  is an active fire protection measure and a source of water provided in most urban suburban and rural areas with municipal water service to enable firefighters to tap into the municipal water supply to assist in extinguishing a fireBuildings near a hydrant may qualify for an insurance discount since firefighters should be able to more rapidly extinguish a fire on the insured propertyThe concept of fire plugs dates to at least the 17th centuryThis was a time when firefighters responding to a call would dig down to the wooden water mains and hastily bore a hole to secure water to fight firesThe water would fill the hole creating a temporary well and be transported from the well to the fire by bucket brigades or later by handpumped fire engines The holes were then plugged with stoppers normally redwood which over time came to be known as fire plugsThe location of the plug would often be recorded or marked so that it could be reused in future firesThis is the source of the colloquial term fire plug still used for fire hydrants todayAfter the Great Fire of London in 1666 the city installed water mains with holes drilled at intervals equipped with risers allowing an access point to the wooden fire plugs from street levelThe invention of a post or pillartype fire hydrant is generally credited to Frederick Graff Sr Chief Engineer of the Philadelphia Water Works around the year 1801It had a combination hosefaucet outlet and was of wet barrel design with the valve in the topIt is said that Graff held the first patent for a fire hydrant but this cannot be verified because the patent office in Washington DC caught on fire in 1836 destroying many patent records from that period in the process

- - how school librarians support students with disabilities in europe
  - Special education or special needs education is the education of students with special needs in a way that addresses the students individual differences and needsIdeally this process involves the individually planned and systematically monitored arrangement of teaching procedures adapted equipment and materials accessible settings and other interventions designed to help learners with special needs achieve a higher level of personal selfsufficiency and success in school and community than would be available if the student were only given access to a typical classroom educationCommon special needs include challenges with learning  communication challenges emotional and behavioral disorders  physical disabilities  and developmental disorders Students with these kinds of special needs are likely to benefit from additional educational services such as different approaches to teaching use of technology a specifically adapted teaching area or resource room Intellectual giftedness is a difference in learning and can also benefit from specialized teaching techniques or different educational programs but the term special education is generally used to specifically indicate instruction of students whose special needs reduce their ability to learn independently or in an ordinary classroom and gifted education is handled separatelyIn most developed countries educators are modifying teaching methods and environments so that the maximum number of students are served in general education environmentsSpecial education in developed countries is often regarded less as a place and more as a range of services available in every schoolIntegration can reduce social stigmas and improve academic achievement for many studentsThe opposite of special education is general educationGeneral education is the standard curriculum presented with standard teaching methods and without additional supports

- - what can i do with a masters of fine arts degree
  - A Master of Fine Arts MFA MFA is a graduate degree typically requiring 23 years of postgraduate study beyond the bachelors degree  BFA  although the term of study will vary by country or by universityThe MFA is a creative degree usually awarded as a terminal degree in visual arts  creative writing  filmmaking  dance  or theatre and other performing arts Coursework is primarily of an applied or performing nature with the program often culminating in a major work or performance Master of Fine Arts programs have generally required a bachelors degree prior to admission but many do not require that the undergraduate major be the same as the MFA field of studyThe most important admissions requirement has often been a sample portfolio or a performance audition The Master of Fine Arts differs from the Master of Arts in that the MFA while an academic program centers around practice in the particular field whereas programs leading to the MA usually center on the scholarly academic or critical study of the fieldAdditionally in the United States an MFA is recognized as a terminal degree for practitioners of Visual Art Design Dance Theatre FilmVideo New Media and Creative Writing  meaning that it is considered to be the highest degree in its field and is used as a minimum qualification to be able to apply to become a FullTime Professor teaching at the University level in these disciplinesThere are exceptions to this standard in the Arts notably in the case of music performance where the MFA is not seen as a terminal degree in the context of the more standardized DMA degreeIt is also critical to note that in the interest of extending the connection between creative production and continued academic research  some universities have established practicebased PhD programs in fields such as creative writing  visual arts  new media  design and theater While this has had an effect in Creative Writing and to a lesser extent in design and new media the influx of graduates from practicebased PhD programs has not appreciably changed the standard for the MFA as the terminal degree in most Arts disciplines yetThis is an ongoing contentious topic and is the frequent subject of academic panels especially at the annual College Art Association conferenceThe CAA 2008 guidelines regarding the MFA strongly reaffirms that the PhD is not required as a terminal degree in the visual arts

- - how many cells are produced during the cell cycle
  - Events involving meiosis showing chromosomal crossoverMeiosis  is a special type of cell division necessary for sexual reproduction in eukaryotes The cells produced by meiosis are gametes or spores In many organisms including all animals and land plants but not some other groups such as fungi  gametes are called sperm and egg cells Whilst the process of meiosis bears a number of similarities with the lifecycle cell division process of mitosis  it differs in two important respectsthe chromosomes in meiosis undergo a recombination which shuffles the genes producing a different genetic combination in each gamete compared with the coexistence of each of the two separate pairs of each chromosome one received from each parent in each cell which results from mitosisthe outcome of meiosis is potentially four genetically unique haploid cells compared with the two genetically identical diploid cells produced from mitosisMeiosis begins with one diploid cell containing two copies of each chromosome one from the organisms mother and one from its fatherThe cell divides twice potentially producing up to four haploid cells containing one copy of each chromosomePotentially because in some cases such as the formation of oocytes in mammals only one of the possible four haploid cells survivesIn animals the haploid cell resulting from meiosis is a male or female gamete Each of the resulting chromosomes in the gamete cells is a unique mixture of maternal and paternal DNA resulting in offspring that are genetically distinct from either parentThis gives rise to genetic diversity in sexually reproducing populationsThis genetic diversity can provide the variation of physical and behavioural attributes  phenotypes  upon which natural selection can act but as described below in Section 6 Origin and function of meiosis the genetic diversity may be largely a byproduct of the homologous recombination that is primarily employed for its DNA repair function during meiosisIt is also noteworthy that during meiosis specific genes are more highly transcribed and these are called the meiome the term used in functional genomics for the meiotic transcriptome Meiosis is a key feature for all sexually reproducing eukaryotes in which homologous chromosome pairing synapse and recombination occurIn addition to strong meiotic stagespecific expression of mRNA the meiome however there are also pervasive translational controls eg selective usage of preformed mRNA regulating the ultimate meiotic stagespecific protein expression of genes during meiosisThus both the meiome and translational controls determine the broad restructuring of meiotic cells needed to carry out meiosisPrior to the meiosis process the cells chromosomes are duplicated by a round of DNA replication  creating from the maternal and paternal versions of each chromosome  homologs  two exact copies sister chromatids  attached at the centromere regionIn the beginning of meiosis the maternal and paternal homologs pair to each otherThen they typically exchange parts by homologous recombination leading to crossovers of DNA between the maternal and paternal versions of the chromosomeSpindle fibers bind to the centromeres of each pair of homologs and arrange the pairs at the spindle equatorThen the fibers pull the recombined homologs to opposite poles of the cellAs the chromosomes move away from the center the cell divides into two daughter cells each containing a haploid number of chromosomes composed of two chromatidsAfter the recombined maternal and paternal homologs have separated into the two daughter cells a second round of cell division occursThere meiosis ends as the two sister chromatids making up each homolog are separated and move into one of the four resulting gamete cellsUpon fertilization  for example when a sperm enters an egg cell two gamete cells produced by meiosis fuseThe gamete from the mother and the gamete from the father each contribute one half of the set of chromosomes that make up the new offsprings genome Meiosis uses many of the same mechanisms as mitosis  a type of cell division used by eukaryotes like plants and animals to split one cell into two identical daughter cellsIn all plants and in many protists meiosis results in the formation of spores  haploid cells that can divide vegetatively without undergoing fertilization

- - how does agreement show grammatical relation
  - Agreement or concord happens when a word changes form depending on the other words to which it relatesIt is an instance of inflection  and usually involves making the value of some grammatical category such as gender or person  agree between different words or parts of the sentenceFor example in Standard English  one may say I am or he is but not I is or he amThis is because the grammar of the language requires that the verb and its subject agree in personThe pronouns I and he are first and third person respectively as are the verb forms am and isThe verb form must be selected so that it has the same person as the subjectThe agreement based on overt grammatical categories as above is formal agreement in contrast to notional agreement  which is based on meaningFor instance the phrase The United States is treated as singular for purposes of agreement even though it is formally plural

  - Digestion is the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food into smaller components that are more easily absorbed into a blood stream  for instanceDigestion is a form of catabolism  a breakdown of large food molecules to smaller onesWhen food enters the mouth digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication  a form of mechanical digestion and the wetting contact of saliva Saliva a liquid secreted by the salivary glands  contains salivary amylase  an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the foodAfter undergoing mastication and starch digestion the food will be in the form of a small round slurry mass called a bolus It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall mucus is secreted by the stomach providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicalsAt the same time protein digestion is occurring mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis  which are waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wallThis allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymesAfter some time typically an hour or two in humans 46 hours in dogs somewhat shorter duration in house cats the resulting thick liquid is called chyme When the pyloric sphincter valve opens chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas  and then passes through the small intestine  in which digestion continuesWhen the chyme is fully digested it is absorbed into the blood95 of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestineWater and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon large intestine where the pH is slightly acidic about 56  69Some vitamins such as biotin and vitamin K K2MK7 produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colonWaste material is eliminated from the rectum during defecation

- - What did the Supreme Court determine in Dred Scott v Sandford
  - Dred Scott v Sandford  also known as the Dred Scott Decision was a landmark decision by the US Supreme Court It made two main rulingsThe first ruling was that AfricanAmericans were not citizens and therefore had no standing to sue in federal courtThe second ruling was that the federal government had no power to regulate slavery in any territory acquired subsequent to the creation of the United StatesGiven the first ruling most scholars and many contemporary political figures including the leadership of the thennew Republican Party considered that the second ruling was not binding precedent but mere dictum The rationale of the Supreme Court regarding the jurisdictional ruling implied that people of African descent both slave and free were not protected by the Constitution and were not US citizens Since passage of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution  both rulings are superseded and no longer valid precedentNonetheless the case retains historical significance as it is widely regarded as the worst decision ever made by the Supreme CourtThe opinion of the court written by Chief Justice Roger B Taney  stirred debateThe decision was 72 and every Justice besides Taney wrote a separate concurrence or dissentFor the first time since Marbury v Madison  the Court held an Act of Congress to be unconstitutionalDred Scott  an AfricanAmerican slave had asked a United States Circuit Court to award him his freedom because he and his master had resided in a state  Illinois  and a territory  Wisconsin Territory  where slavery had been bannedChief Justice Roger Taney  writing for the court held that Scott as a person of African ancestry was not a citizen of the United States and therefore had no right to sue in federal courtThis holding was contrary to the practice of numerous states at the time particularly Free states  where free blacks did in fact enjoy the rights of citizens such as the right to vote and hold public officeIn what is sometimes considered mere obiter dictum  the Court went on to hold that Congress had no authority to prohibit slavery in federal territories because slaves are personal property and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution protects property owners against deprivation of their property without due process of law In reaching this decision Taney had hoped to settle the growing controversy surrounding slavery in the United States but it had the opposite effectThe decision was fiercely debated across the country as perhaps best exemplified by the LincolnDouglas debates of 1858Abraham Lincoln  the secondever Republican nominee for President was able to win the presidential election in 1860  the stopping of the further expansion of slavery was a key Republican party plankThe decision played an important role in the timing of state secession and the Civil War although it is extreme to say the decision caused the warThe decision is acknowledged for the influential role it played in altering the national political landscape it is credited with launching Abraham Lincolns national political career and ultimately allowing for his electionAlthough the Supreme Court has never explicitly overruled the Dred Scott case the Court stated in the SlaughterHouse Cases that at least one part of it had already been overruled by the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 which begins by stating All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they resideTo which the Court notedThe first observation we have to make on this clause is that it puts at rest both the questions which we stated to have been the subject of differences of opinionIt declares that persons may be citizens of the United States without regard to their citizenship of a particular State and it overturns the Dred Scott decision by making all persons born within the United States and subject to its jurisdiction citizens of the United States

- - what kind of material was able to survive near the sun during the development of the solar system
  - Artists conception of a protoplanetary diskThe formation and of the Solar System is estimated to have begun 46 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud Most of the collapsing mass collected in the centre forming the Sun  while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets  moons  asteroids  and other small Solar System bodies formedThis widely accepted model known as the nebular hypothesis  was first developed in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg  Immanuel Kant  and PierreSimon Laplace Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy  physics  geology  and planetary science Since the dawn of the space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observationsThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formationMany moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planetsStill others as the Earth s Moon  may be the result of giant collisions Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar SystemThe positions of the planets often shifted and planets have switched placesThis planetary migration is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar Systems early evolutionIn roughly 5 billion years the Sun will cool and expand outward many times its current diameter becoming a red giant  before casting off its outer layers as a planetary nebula and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a white dwarf In the far distant future the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Suns retinue of planetsSome planets will be destroyed others ejected into interstellar spaceUltimately over the course of tens of billions of years it is likely that the Sun will be left with none of the original bodies in orbit around it

- - what happens when the baroreceptor reflex is activated
  - The baroreflex or baroreceptor reflex is one of the bodys homeostatic mechanisms for maintaining blood pressure It provides a negative feedback loop in which an elevated blood pressure reflexively causes heart rate to decrease therefore causing blood pressure to decrease likewise decreased blood pressure activates the baroreflex causing heart rate to increase thus causing an increase in blood pressureThe system relies on specialized neurons  known as baroreceptors  in the aortic arch  carotid sinuses  and elsewhere to monitor changes in blood pressure and relay them to the brainstem Subsequent changes in blood pressure are mediated by the autonomic nervous system Atrial natriuretic peptide forms a parallel negative feedback loop in an endocrinological contrast to the reninangiotensin system

- - how many percent is a basis point
  - A basis point often denoted as bp colloquially referred to in the plural as bips also known as a beep is a unit equal to one hundredth of a percentage point  or one part per ten thousand  110000The same unit is also rarely called a permyriad literally meaning for every myriad ten thousand and in that context is written with which looks like a percent sign  with two extra zeroes at the end like a stylized form of the four zeros in the denominator  although it originates as a natural extension of the percent  and permille  signsA basis point is defined as1 basis point  1 permyriad  one onehundredth percent1 bp  1  001  01  104   000011  100 bp  100Basis points are used as a convenient unit of measurement in contexts where percentage differences of less than 1 are discussedThe most common example is interest rates  where differences in interest rates of less than 1 per year are usually meaningful to talk aboutFor example a difference of 010 percentage points is equivalent to a change of 10 basis points eg a 467 rate increases by 10 basis points to 477Like percentage points  basis points avoid the ambiguity between relative and absolute discussions about interest rates by dealing only with the absolute change in numeric value of a rateFor example if a report says there has been a 1 increase from a 10 interest rate this could refer to an increase either from 10 to 101 relative 1 of 10 or from 10 to 11 absolute 1 plus 10If however the report says there has been a 10 basis point increase from a 10 interest rate then we know that the interest rate of 10 has increased by 010 the absolute change to a 101 rateIt is common practice in the financial industry to use basis points to denote a rate change in a financial instrument  or the difference  spread  between two interest rates including the yields of fixedincome securities Since certain loans and bonds may commonly be quoted in relation to some index or underlying security  they will often be quoted as a spread over or under the indexFor example a loan that bears interest of 050 per annum above the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR is said to be 50 basis points over LIBOR which is commonly expressed as L50bps or simply L50The term basis point has its origins in trading the basis or the spread between two interest ratesSince the basis is usually small these are quoted multiplied up by 10000 and hence a full point movement in the basis is a basis pointContrast with pips in FX forward marketsThe relationship between percentage changes and basis points can be summarized as follows 1 percentage point change  100 basis points and 001 percentage points  1 basis pointSo a bond whose yield increases from 5 to 55 is said to increase by 50 basis points or interest rates that have risen 1 percentage point are said to have increased by 100 basis points

- - how many classes of vitamins
  - A bottle of high potency Bcomplex vitamin supplement pillsA vitamin  or  is an organic compound required by an organism as a vital nutrient in limited amountsAn organic chemical compound or related set of compounds is called a vitamin when it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism and must be obtained from the dietThus the term is conditional both on the circumstances and on the particular organismFor example ascorbic acid  vitamin C  is a vitamin for humans but not for most other animals and biotin and vitamin D are required in the human diet only in certain circumstancesBy convention the term vitamin includes neither other essential nutrients  such as dietary minerals  essential fatty acids  or essential amino acids which are needed in larger amounts than vitamins nor the large number of other nutrients that promote health but are otherwise required less oftenThirteen vitamins are universally recognized at presentVitamins are classified by their biological and chemical activity not their structureThus each vitamin refers to a number of vitamer compounds that all show the biological activity associated with a particular vitaminSuch a set of chemicals is grouped under an alphabetized vitamin generic descriptor title such as  vitamin A  which includes the compounds retinal  retinol  and four known carotenoids Vitamers by definition are convertible to the active form of the vitamin in the body and are sometimes interconvertible to one another as wellVitamins have diverse biochemical functionsSome have hormonelike functions as regulators of mineral metabolism such as vitamin D or regulators of cell and tissue growth and differentiation such as some forms of vitamin A Others function as antioxidants eg vitamin E and sometimes vitamin C The largest number of vitamins such as B complex vitamins function as precursors for enzyme cofactors  that help enzymes in their work as catalysts in metabolism In this role vitamins may be tightly bound to enzymes as part of prosthetic groups  For example biotin is part of enzymes involved in making fatty acids Vitamins may also be less tightly bound to enzyme catalysts as coenzymes  detachable molecules that function to carry chemical groups or electrons between moleculesFor example folic acid may carry methyl  formyl  and methylene groups in the cellAlthough these roles in assisting enzymesubstrate reactions are vitamins bestknown function the other vitamin functions are equally importantUntil the mid1930s when the first commercial yeastextract vitamin B complex and semisynthetic vitamin C supplement tablets were sold vitamins were obtained solely through food intake and changes in diet which for example could occur during a particular growing season usually greatly altered the types and amounts of vitamins ingestedHowever vitamins have been produced as commodity chemicals and made widely available as inexpensive semisynthetic and syntheticsource multivitamin dietary and food supplements and additives since the middle of the 20th century

- - how does uv light activated fluorescence
  - Fluorescent minerals emit visible light when exposed to ultraviolet lightFluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation It is a form of luminescence In most cases the emitted light has a longer wavelength and therefore lower energy than the absorbed radiationHowever when the absorbed electromagnetic radiation is intense it is possible for one electron to absorb two photons  this twophoton absorption can lead to emission of radiation having a shorter wavelength than the absorbed radiationThe emitted radiation may also be of the same wavelength as the absorbed radiation termed resonance fluorescenceThe most striking examples of fluorescence occur when the absorbed radiation is in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum  and thus invisible to the human eye and the emitted light is in the visible regionFluorescence has many practical applications including mineralogy  gemology  chemical sensors  fluorescence spectroscopy  fluorescent labelling  dyes  biological detectors and most commonly fluorescent lamps

- - What implications does the law of conservation of matter have for humans
  - Antoine Lavoisier s discovery of the Law of Conservation of Mass led to many new findings in the 19th centuryJoseph Proust s law of definite proportions and John Dalton s atomic theory branched from the discoveries of Antoine LavoisierLavoisiers quantitative experiments revealed that combustion involved oxygen rather than what was previously thought to be phlogiston The law of conservation of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy both of which have mass the mass of the system must remain constant over time as system mass cannot change quantity if it is not added or removedHence the quantity of mass is conserved over timeThe law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed although it may be rearranged in space or the entities associated with it may be changed in form as for example when light or physical work is transformed into particles that contribute the same mass to the system as the light or work had contributedThe law implies requires that during any chemical reaction  nuclear reaction  or radioactive decay in an isolated system the mass of the reactants or starting material must equal the mass of the productsThe concept of mass conservation is widely used in many fields such as chemistry  mechanics  and fluid dynamics Historically mass conservation was discovered in chemical reactions by Antoine Lavoisier in the late 18th century and was of crucial importance in the progress from alchemy to the modern natural science of chemistry The closely related concept of matter conservation was found to hold good in chemistry to such high approximation that it failed only for the high energies treated by the later refinements of relativity theory but otherwise remains useful and sufficiently accurate for most chemical calculations even in modern practiceIn special relativity  needed for accuracy when large energy transfers between systems is involved the difference between thermodynamically closed and isolated systems becomes important since conservation of mass is strictly and perfectly upheld only for socalled isolated systems  ie those completely isolated from all exchanges with the environmentIn this circumstance the massenergy equivalence theorem states that mass conservation is equivalent to total energy conservation which is the first law of thermodynamics By contrast for a thermodynamically closed system ie one which is closed to exchanges of matter but open to exchanges of nonmaterial energy such as heat and work with the surroundings mass is usually only approximately conservedThe input or output of nonmaterial energy must change the mass of the system in relativity theory although the change is usually small since relatively large amounts of such energy by comparison with ordinary experience carry only a small amount of mass again by ordinary standards of measurementIn special relativity mass is not converted to energy since energy in all of its forms always retains its equivalent amount of mass throughout any transformation or translocation into or out of a systemHowever certain types of matter a different concept may be converted to energy so long as the mass of the system is unchanged in the processHowever if such energy is removed from systems they must lose the mass that is associated with itIn general relativity  mass and energy conservation in expanding volumes of space is a complex concept subject to different definitions and neither mass nor energy is as strictly and simply conserved as is the case in special relativity and in Minkowski space For a discussion see mass in general relativity

  - A eukaryote  or  is an organism whose cells contain complex structures enclosed within membranes Eukaryotes may more formally be referred to as the taxon Eukarya or EukaryotaThe defining membranebound structure that sets eukaryotic cells apart from prokaryotic cells is the nucleus  or nuclear envelope  within which the genetic material is carriedThe presence of a nucleus gives eukaryotes their name which comes from the Greek eu good and karyon nut or kernelMost eukaryotic cells also contain other membranebound organelles such as mitochondria  chloroplasts and the Golgi apparatus All large complex organisms are eukaryotes including animals  plants and fungi The group also includes many unicellular organisms Cell division in eukaryotes is different from that in organisms without a nucleus  Prokaryote It involves separating the duplicated chromosomes  through movements directed by microtubulesThere are two types of division processesIn mitosis  one cell divides to produce two genetically identical cellsIn meiosis  which is required in sexual reproduction  one diploid cell having two instances of each chromosome one from each parent undergoes recombination of each pair of parental chromosomes and then two stages of cell division resulting in four haploid cells  gametes Each gamete has just one complement of chromosomes each a unique mix of the corresponding pair of parental chromosomesEukaryota appears to be monophyletic  and so makes up one of the three domains of lifeThe two other domains Bacteria and Archaea  are prokaryotes and have none of the above featuresEukaryotes represent a tiny minority of all living things even in a human body there are 10 times more microbes than human cellsHowever due to their much larger size their collective worldwide biomass is estimated at about equal to that of prokaryotesThey are considered to have first developed approximately 1621 billion years ago

- - How did the pendulum improve upon earlier clocks
  - Simple gravity pendulum model assumes no friction or air resistanceAn exemplar animation of a pendulum showing the velocity and acceleration vectorsA pendulum is a weight suspended from a so that it can swing freelyWhen a pendulum is displaced sideways from its resting equilibrium position  it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium positionWhen released the restoring force combined with the pendulums mass causes it to oscillate about the equilibrium position swinging back and forthThe time for one complete cycle a left swing and a right swing is called the period A pendulum swings with a specific period which depends mainly on its lengthFrom its discovery around 1602 by Galileo Galilei the regular motion of pendulums was used for timekeeping and was the worlds most accurate timekeeping technology until the 1930sPendulums are used to regulate pendulum clocks  and are used in scientific instruments such as accelerometers and seismometers Historically they were used as gravimeters to measure the acceleration of gravity in geophysical surveys and even as a standard of lengthThe word pendulum is new Latin  from the Latin pendulus meaning hangingThe simple gravity pendulum is an idealized mathematical model of a pendulumThis is a weight or bob  on the end of a massless cord suspended from a  without friction When given an initial push it will swing back and forth at a constant amplitude Real pendulums are subject to friction and air drag  so the amplitude of their swings declines

- - how many innings makes an official game
  - An official game in baseball  also sometimes called a regulation game is a game that has progressed beyond the point at which it can be considered complete if necessaryThis is approximately the halfway point of the gameIn the case of inclement weather  any game which has reached this point may be stopped and shortened as needed with the result being final and all records and statistics countedA game which has not reached this point before being stopped is either considered a suspended game to be continued at a later date from the point of stoppage or is simply canceled and replayed from the startThis depends on the rules of each individual league In either case no statistics are counted until the game becomes officialSince most professional baseball games are nine innings long the fifth inning is used as the threshold for an official gameIf the visiting team is leading or the game is tied the end of the fifth inning marks this pointIf the home team which bats last is already ahead in the score and theoretically would not need its half of the fifth inning then 412 innings ie the middle of the fifth is considered an official gameThe game is also considered official if the home team scores to take the lead in the bottom of the fifth inning since the game would end immediately if the same thing happened in the ninthIn nearly all cases the official game status is used to determine whether a rain check will be honored for fans holding ticketsIf a game is started but does not reach the point of becoming official fans are entitled to a new ticket for the makeup game or in most cases any other available game of their choiceIf a game is halted after it becomes official the game is simply shortened and no rain check is givenThe official game statistic received some attention during the 1995 season when Cal Ripken Jr was approaching the record for consecutive games played  previously held by Lou Gehrig Large numbers were hung on the side of the BO Warehouse at Oriole Park at Camden Yards to show the number of games in Ripkens streakEach day a new number was unfurled during the fifth inning after each game had become official since the statistic would not have counted if the game had been stopped before that pointA similar practice has been used to count down toward the demolition of several stadiums including Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia in 2003 Busch Memorial Stadium in St Louis in 2005 and the original Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium in New York City in 2008 as each game became official the team would unveil a new lower number showing the number of games left to be played in the stadium
- - how did phone numbers get split 3 than 4
  - A telephone number or phone number is a sequence of digits used to call from one telephone line to another in a public switched telephone network When telephone numbers were invented they were short  as few as one two or three digits  and were given orally to a switchboard operator As phone systems have grown and interconnected to encompass the world telephone numbers have become longerIn addition to telephones  they now access other devices such as computers and fax machines The number contains the information necessary to identify uniquely the intended endpoint for the telephone call Each such endpoint must have a unique number within the public switched telephone network Most countries use fixed length numbers for normal lines at least and therefore the number of endpoints determines the necessary length of the telephone numberIt is also possible for each subscriber to have a set of shorter numbers for the endpoints most often usedThese shorthand or speed calling numbers are automatically translated to unique telephone numbers before the call can be connectedSome special services have their own short numbers eg 119  911  000  999  111  and 112 being the Emergency Services numbers for China Japan South Korea Taiwan and Sri Lanka Canada and the United States Australia the United Kingdom Ireland South Africa Poland Saudi Arabia the United Arab Emirates Morocco Macao Bahrain Qatar Bangladesh Botswana Ghana Kenya Hong Kong Malaysia Mauritius Singapore Zimbabwe Trinidad Tobago New Zealand Kuwait and the European Union respectivelyMany systems also allow calls within a local area to be made without dialing the local area codeFor example a phone number in North America will start with three numbers such as 661 which is the area code followed by seven digits split into sections of three and four such as 5501212 which is the local numberSome areas now have mandatory tendigit dialing in place even for local callsMost telephone networks today exceptions being private intercom and secure phone networks are interconnected in the international telephone network where the format of telephone numbers is standardized by ITUT in the recommendation E164 This specifies that the entire number should be 15 digits or shorter and begin with a country prefix For most countries this is followed by an area code or city code and the subscriber number which might consist of the code for a particular telephone exchange ITUT recommendation E123 describes how to represent an international telephone number in writing or print starting with a plus sign  and the country codeWhen calling an international number from a fixed line phone the  must be replaced with the international call prefix chosen by the country the call is being made fromSome mobile phones allow the  to be entered directlyThe format and allocation of local phone numbers are controlled by each nations respective government either directly or by sponsored organizations such as NANPA overseen by NeuStar Inc Before a telephone call is connected the telephone number must be dialed by the calling party or CallerThe called party might have equipment that presents caller ID before the call is answered

- - what form of decay does not change the atomic number of them decaying atom
  - Alpha decay is one example type of radioactive decay in which an atomic nucleus emits an alpha particle  and thereby transforms or decays into an atom with a mass number 4 less and atomic number 2 lessMany other types of decays are possibleRadioactive decay also known as nuclear decay or radioactivity is the process by which a nucleus of an unstable atom loses energy by emitting particles of ionizing radiation A material that spontaneously emits this kind of radiation  which includes the emission of energetic alpha particles  beta particles  and gamma rays  is considered radioactiveThere are many different types of radioactive decay see table belowA decay or loss of energy results when an atom with one type of nucleus called the parent radionuclide  transforms to an atom with a nucleus in a different state or to a different nucleus containing different numbers of protons and neutrons Either of these products is named the daughter nuclideIn some decays the parent and daughter are different chemical elements  and thus the decay process results in nuclear transmutation creation of an atom of a new elementThe first decay processes to be discovered were alpha decay  beta decay  and gamma decay Alpha decay occurs when the nucleus ejects an alpha particle helium nucleusThis is the most common process of emitting nucleons  but in rarer types of decays nuclei can eject protons  or specific nuclei of other elements in the process called cluster decay Beta decay occurs when the nucleus emits an electron or positron and a type of neutrino  in a process that changes a proton to a neutron or the other way aroundThe nucleus may capture an orbiting electron converting a proton into a neutron  electron capture All of these processes result in nuclear transmutationBy contrast there exist radioactive decay processes that do not result in transmutationThe energy of an excited nucleus may be emitted as a gamma ray in gamma decay or used to eject an orbital electron by interaction with the excited nucleus in a process called internal conversion Radioisotopes occasionally emit neutrons and this results in a change in an element from one isotope to anotherOne type of radioactive decay results in products which are not defined but appear in a range of pieces of the original nucleusThis decay is called spontaneous fission This decay happens when a large unstable nucleus spontaneously splits into two and occasionally three smaller daughter nuclei and usually emits gamma rays neutrons or other particles as a consequenceRadioactive decay is a stochastic ie random process at the level of single atoms in that according to quantum theory  it is impossible to predict when a particular atom will decayHowever the chance that a given atom will decay is constant over timeFor a large number of atoms the decay rate for the collection is computable from the measured decay constants of the nuclides or equivalently from the halflifes

- - what can electrical energy be transformed into
  - Energy Transformation in Energy Systems LanguageEnergy transformation or energy conversion is the process of changing one form of energy to anotherIn physics the term energy describes the capacity to produce certain changes within a system without regard to limitations in transformation imposed by Entropy Changes in total energy of systems can only be accomplished by adding or subtracting energy from them as energy is a quantity which is conserved according to the first law of thermodynamics According to special relativity  changes in the energy of systems will also coincide with changes in the systems mass  and the total amount of mass of a system is a measure of its energyEnergy in a system may be transformed so that it resides in a different state or a different type of energyEnergy in many states may be used to do many varieties of physical workEnergy may be used in natural processes or machines or else to provide some service to society such as heat light  or motion For example an internal combustion engine converts the potential chemical energy in gasoline and oxygen into heat  which is then transformed into the propulsive energy  kinetic energy that moves a vehicleA solar cell converts solar radiation into electrical energy that can then be used to light a bulb or power a computerThe generic name for a device which converts energy from one form to another is a transducer In general most types of energy save for thermal energy may be converted efficiently to any other kind of energySometimes this occurs with an efficiency of essentially 100 such as when potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as an object falls in vacuum or when it orbits nearer or farther from another object in spaceConversion of other types of energies to heat may also occurs with nearly perfect efficiency many types of friction do thisExceptions for perfect conversion efficiency even for isolated systems occur when energy has already been partly distributed among many available quantum states for a collection of particles which are freely allowed to explore any state of momentum and position  phase space In such circumstances a measure called Entropy  or eveningout of energy distribution in such states dictates that future states of the system must be of at least equal evenness in energy distributionThere is no way taking the universe as a whole to collect energy into fewer states once it has spread to themA consequence of this requirement is that there are limitations to the efficiency with which thermal energy can be converted to other kinds of energy since thermal energy in equilibrium at a given temperature already represents the maximal eveningout of energy between all possible statesSuch energy is sometimes considered degraded energy because it is not entirely usableThe second law of thermodynamics is a way of stating that for this reason thermal energy in a system may be converted to other kinds of energy with efficiencies approaching 100 only if the entropy evenness or disorder of the universe is increased by other means to compensate for the decrease in entropy associated with the disappearance of the thermal energy and its entropy contentOtherwise only a part of thermal energy may be converted to other kinds of energy and thus useful work since the remainder of the heat must be reserved to be transferred to a thermal reservoir at a lower temperature in such a way that the increase in Entropy for this process more than compensates for the entropy decrease associated with transformation of the rest of the heat into other types of energy

- - what are use taxes
  - A use tax in United States is complementary to sales tax which means if you buy a Taxable productservices without paying any Sales tax to vendor you owe use taxYou must self assess use tax and pay it directly to the state where the products were consumed or services were renderedUse tax typically is a tax on consumption but if you buy an item without paying sales tax and store it in your warehouse initially use tax applies to that location where goods were storedLater on when the final consumption takes place at some other location you are required to pay the differential of tax rate to the jurisdiction of ultimate place of consumptionThis really means that you dont have to pay both Sales Tax as well as Use Tax on one transactionIt is only one or the other that you are required to pay on purchase of taxable productsservicesIf vendor doesnt charge any Sales tax on its invoice then it is the obligation of the buyer to self assess Use tax and pay it to the appropriate JurisdicationUse Tax is generally charged at the same tax rate of Sales Tax but in some states the tax rate is differentUse tax is also termed as Consumption Tax or Consumer Use TaxA use tax is a type of excise tax levied in the United States by numerous state governmentsIt is assessed upon tangible personal property purchased by a resident of the assessing state for use storage or consumption in that state not for resale regardless of where the purchase took placeIf a resident of a state makes a purchase within his home state full sales tax is paid at the time of the transactionThe use tax applies when a resident of the assessing state purchases an item that is not subject to his home states sales taxUsually this is due to outofstate purchases as well as ordering items through the mail by phone or over the Internet from other statesThe use tax is typically assessed at the same rate as the sales tax that would have been owed if any had the same goods been purchased in the state of residenceFor example a resident of Massachusetts  with a 625 sales and use tax on certain goods and services purchases nonexempt goods or services in New Hampshire for use storage or other consumption in MassachusettsUnder New Hampshire law the New Hampshire vendor collects no sales taxes on the goods but the Massachusetts purchaseruser must still pay 625 of the sales price directly to the Department of Revenue in Massachusetts as a use taxIf the same goods are purchased in a US state that does collect sales tax for such goods at time of purchase whatever taxes were paid by the purchaser to that state can be deducted as a tax credit  from the 625 owed for subsequent use storage or consumption in MassachusettsWith few exceptions no states vendors will charge the native states sales tax on goods shipped out of state meaning all goods ordered from outofstate are essentially free of sales taxThe purchaser is therefore required to declare and pay the use tax to his home state on these ordered goodsThe assessing jurisdiction may make the use tax payable annually but some states require a monthly paymentFor example where a Vermont resident has not paid at least 6 sales tax on property brought in for use in the state Vermont law requires filing a tax return Form SU452 and payment by the 20th day of the month following nonexempt purchases to avoid a 50 late fee a 5 penalty per month to a maximum of 25 plus statutory interest on the unpaid tax and penaltiesTypical exemptions include purchases by charitable nonprofit organizations or governmental agencies purchases for resale in commerce and purchases via casual sales by individuals not in the ordinary course of businessAlso note that there are thousands of tax jurisdictions in the US and many have everchanging lists of specific types of goods and services that are not taxableAs an illustration of the complexities a 2006 Massachusetts law requires payment of tax on prewritten not custom software purchased and downloaded over the Internet for installation and use in Massachusetts regardless of where it originatesHowever the actual use of the same software downloaded by a Massachusetts resident to a server in another state remains a nontaxed serviceIn contrast Arkansas generally does not tax anything delivered over the Internet such as downloaded software or music except VoIP which is specifically defined as taxable telecommunications servicesSoftware prewritten or custom delivered thru a tangible medium ie on disk in Arkansas is taxable even if ordered online except custom software for a particular customer which is nontaxable programming services even if delivered on a diskIn most cases this complexity is part of the underlying sales tax laws but while a brickandmortar store has to deal with only the sales tax laws of its own location remote sellers have to deal with the use tax laws of many jurisdictionsup to every US state and locality that assesses them if the company has a presence or nexus in every state as large brickandmortar sellers like WalMart and Best Buy do

- - what is an assist in basketball
  - In basketball  an assist is attributed to a player who passes the ball to a teammate in a way that leads to a score by field goal  meaning that he or she was assisting in the basketThere is some judgment involved in deciding whether a passer should be credited with an assistAn assist can be scored for the passer even if the player who receives the pass makes a basket after dribbling the ballHowever the original definition of an assist did not include such situations so the comparison of assist statistics across eras is a complex matterOnly the pass directly before the score may be counted as an assist so no more than one assist can be recorded per field goal unlike in other sports such as ice hockey A pass that leads to a shooting foul and scoring by free throws does not count as an assist in the NBA but does in FIBA play only one assist is awarded per set of free throws in which at least one free throw is madePoint guards tend to get the most assists per game apg as their role is primarily that of a passer and ballhandlerCenters tend to get fewer assists but centers with good floor presence and court vision can dominate a team by assistingBeing inside the key the center often has the best angles and the best position for dishes and other short passes in the scoring areaCenter Wilt Chamberlain led the NBA in assists in 1968A strong center with insidescoring prowess such as former NBA center Hakeem Olajuwon  can also be an effective assistor because the defenses doubleteaming tends to open up offense in the form of shootersThe NBA singlegame assist record is 30 held by Scott Skiles of the Orlando Magic against the Denver Nuggets on December 30 1990The NBA record for most career assists is held by John Stockton with 15806

  - The GrecoPersian Wars also often called the Persian Wars were a series of conflicts between the Achaemenid Empire of Persia and citystates of the Hellenic world that started in 499 BC and lasted until 449 BCThe collision between the fractious political world of the Greeks and the enormous empire of the Persians began when Cyrus the Great conquered Ionia in 547 BCStruggling to rule the independentminded cities of Ionia the Persians appointed tyrants to rule each of themThis would prove to be the source of much trouble for the Greeks and Persians alikeIn 499 BC the then tyrant of Miletus  Aristagoras  embarked on an expedition to conquer the island of Naxos  with Persian support however the expedition was a debacle and preempting his dismissal Aristagoras incited all of Hellenic Asia Minor into rebellion against the PersiansThis was the beginning of the Ionian Revolt  which would last until 493 BC progressively drawing more regions of Asia Minor into the conflictAristagoras secured military support from Athens and Eretria  and in 498 BC these forces helped to capture and burn the Persian regional capital of Sardis The Persian king Darius the Great vowed to have revenge on Athens and Eretria for this actThe revolt continued with the two sides effectively stalemated throughout 497495 BCIn 494 BC the Persians regrouped and attacked the epicentre of the revolt in MiletusAt the Battle of Lade  the Ionians suffered a decisive defeat and the rebellion collapsed with the final members being stamped out the following yearSeeking to secure his empire from further revolts and from the interference of the mainland Greeks Darius embarked on a scheme to conquer Greece and to punish Athens and Eretria for burning SardisThe first Persian invasion of Greece began in 492 BC with the Persian general Mardonius conquering Thrace and Macedon before several mishaps forced an early end to the campaignIn 490 BC a second force was sent to Greece this time across the Aegean Sea  under the command of Datis and Artaphernes This expedition subjugated the Cyclades  before besieging capturing and razing EretriaHowever while en route to attack Athens the Persian force was decisively defeated by the Athenians at the Battle of Marathon  ending Persian efforts for the time beingDarius then began to plan to complete the conquest of Greece but died in 486 BC and responsibility for the conquest passed to his son Xerxes I In 480 BC Xerxes personally led the second Persian invasion of Greece with one of the largest ancient armies ever assembledVictory over the Allied Greek states led by Sparta and Athens at the Battle of Thermopylae allowed the Persians to torch Athens and overrun most of GreeceHowever while seeking to destroy the combined Greek fleet the Persians suffered a severe defeat at the Battle of Salamis The following year the confederated Greeks went on the offensive defeating the Persian army at the Battle of Plataea  and ending the invasion of GreeceThe allied Greeks followed up their success by destroying the rest of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Mycale  before expelling Persian garrisons from Sestos 479 BC and Byzantium 478 BCThe actions of the general Pausanias at the siege of Byzantium alienated many of the Greek states from the Spartans and the antiPersian alliance was therefore reconstituted around Athenian leadership as the socalled Delian League The Delian League continued to campaign against Persia for the next three decades beginning with the expulsion of the remaining Persian garrisons from EuropeAt the Battle of the Eurymedon in 466 BC the League won a double victory that finally secured freedom for the cities of IoniaHowever the Leagues involvement in an Egyptian revolt from 460454 BC resulted in a disastrous defeat and further campaigning was suspendedA fleet was sent to Cyprus in 451 BC but achieved little and when it withdrew the GrecoPersian Wars drew to a quiet endSome historical sources suggest the end of hostilities was marked by a peace treaty between Athens and Persia the socalled Peace of Callias

- - when did thomson make the plumpudding model
  - A schematic presentation of the plum pudding model of the atom  in Thomsons mathematical model the corpuscles or modern electrons  were arranged nonrandomly in rotating ringsThe current model of the subatomic structure involves a dense nucleus surrounded by a probabilistic cloud of electronsThe plum pudding model of the atom by J J Thomson  who discovered the electron in 1897 was proposed in 1904 before the discovery of the atomic nucleus in order to add the electron to the atomic modelIn this model the atom is composed of electrons which Thomson still called corpuscles though G J Stoney had proposed that atoms of electricity be called electrons in 1894 surrounded by a soup of positive charge to balance the electrons negative charges like negatively charged  plums  surrounded by positively charged  pudding The electrons as we know them today were thought to be positioned throughout the atom but with many structures possible for positioning multiple electrons particularly rotating rings of electrons see belowInstead of a soup the atom was also sometimes said to have had a cloud of positive chargeWith this model Thomson abandoned his earlier nebular atom hypothesis in which the atom was composed of immaterial vorticesNow at least part of the atom was to be composed of Thomsons particulate negative corpuscles although the rest of the positively charged part of the atom remained somewhat nebulous and illdefinedThe 1904 Thomson model was disproved by the 1909 gold foil experiment of Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden This was interpreted by Ernest Rutherford in 1911to imply a very small nucleus of the atom containing a very high positive charge in the case of gold enough to balance about 100 electrons thus leading to the Rutherford model of the atomAlthough gold has an atomic number of 79 immediately after Rutherfords paper appeared in 1911 Antonius Van den Broek made the intuitive suggestion that atomic number is nuclear chargeThe matter required experiment to decideHenry Moseley s work showed experimentally in 1913 see Moseleys law  that the effective nuclear charge was very close to the atomic number Moseley found only one unit difference and Moseley referenced only the papers of Van den Broek and RutherfordThis work culminated in the solarsystemlike but quantumlimited Bohr model of the atom in the same year in which a nucleus containing an atomic number of positive charge is surrounded by an equal number of electrons in orbital shellsBohr had also inspired Moseleys workThomsons model was compared though not by Thomson to a British dessert called plum pudding  hence the nameThomsons paper was published in the March 1904 edition of the Philosophical Magazine  the leading British science journal of the dayIn Thomsons view  the atoms of the elements consist of a number of negatively electrified corpuscles enclosed in a sphere of uniform positive electrification In this model the electrons were free to rotate within the blob or cloud of positive substanceThese orbits were stabilized in the model by the fact that when an electron moved farther from the center of the positive cloud it felt a larger net positive inward force because there was more material of opposite charge inside its orbit see Gausss law In Thomsons model electrons were free to rotate in rings which were further stabilized by interactions between the electrons and spectra were to be accounted for by energy differences of different ring orbitsThomson attempted to make his model account for some of the major spectral lines known for some elements but was not notably successful at thisStill Thomsons model along with a similar Saturnian ring model for atomic electrons  also put forward in 1904 by Nagaoka after James Clerk Maxwell s model of Saturns rings  were earlier harbingers of the later and more successful solarsystemlike Bohr model of the atom

- - when us subprime mortgage market collapse
  - The US subprime mortgage crisis was a set of events and conditions that led to a financial crisis and subsequent recession that began in 2008It was characterized by a rise in subprime mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures and the resulting decline of securities backed by said mortgagesSeveral major financial institutions collapsed in September 2008 with significant disruption in the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and the onset of a severe global recessionThere were many causes of the crisis with commentators assigning different levels of blame to financial institutions regulators credit agencies government housing policies and consumers among othersA proximate cause was the rise in subprime lendingThe percentage of lowerquality subprime mortgages originated during a given year rose from the historical 8 or lower range to approximately 20 from 2004 to 2006 with much higher ratios in some parts of the USA high percentage of these subprime mortgages over 90 in 2006 for example were adjustablerate mortgages These two changes were part of a broader trend of lowered lending standards and higherrisk mortgage productsFurther US households had become increasingly indebted with the ratio of debt to disposable personal income rising from 77 in 1990 to 127 at the end of 2007 much of this increase mortgagerelatedWhen US home prices declined steeply after peaking in mid2006 borrowers ability to refinance their loans became more difficultAs adjustablerate mortgages began to reset at higher interest rates causing higher monthly payments mortgage delinquencies soaredSecurities backed with mortgages including subprime mortgages widely held by financial firms globally lost most of their valueGlobal investors also drastically reduced purchases of mortgagebacked debt and other securities as part of a decline in the capacity and willingness of the private financial system to support lendingConcerns about the soundness of US credit and financial markets led to tightening credit around the world and slowing economic growth in the US and EuropeThe crisis had severe longlasting consequences for the US and European economiesThe US entered a deep recession with nearly 9 million jobs lost during 2008 and 2009 roughly 6 of the workforceUS housing prices fell nearly 30 on average and the US stock market fell approximately 50 by early 2009As of early 2013 the US stock market had recovered to its precrisis peak but housing prices remained near their low point and unemployment remained elevatedEconomic growth remained below precrisis levelsEurope also continued to struggle with its own economic crisis

- - where translation on DNA happens
  - Overview of the translation of eukaryotic messenger RNADiagram showing the translation of mRNA and the synthesis of proteins by a ribosomeIn molecular biology and genetics  translation is the process through which cellular ribosomes manufacture proteins It is part of the process of gene expression In translation messenger RNA mRNA produced by transcription is decoded by the ribosome to produce a specific amino acid chain or polypeptide  that will later fold into an active proteinIn bacteria translation occurs in the cells cytoplasm  where the large and small subunits of the ribosome are located and bind to the mRNAIn eukaryotes translation occurs across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum in a process called vectorial synthesis The ribosome facilitates decoding by inducing the binding of tRNAs with complementary anticodon sequences to that of the mRNAThe tRNAs carry specific amino acids that are chained together into a polypeptide as the mRNA passes through and is read by the ribosome in a fashion reminiscent to that of a stock ticker and ticker tape In many instances the entire ribosomemRNA complex binds to the outer membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and releases the nascent protein polypeptide inside for later vesicle transport and secretion outside of the cellMany types of transcribed RNA such as transfer RNA ribosomal RNA and small nuclear RNA do not undergo translation into proteinsTranslation proceeds in four phases initiation elongation translocation and termination all describing the growth of the amino acid chain or polypeptide that is the product of translationAmino acids are brought to ribosomes and assembled into proteinsIn activation the correct amino acid is covalently bonded to the correct transfer RNA tRNA The amino acid is joined by its carboxyl group to the 3 OH of the tRNA by an ester bond When the tRNA has an amino acid linked to it it is termed chargedInitiation involves the small subunit of the ribosome binding to the 5 end of mRNA with the help of initiation factors IFTermination of the polypeptide happens when the A site of the ribosome faces a stop codon UAA UAG or UGANo tRNA can recognize or bind to this codonInstead the stop codon induces the binding of a release factor protein that prompts the disassembly of the entire ribosomemRNA complexA number of antibiotics act by inhibiting translation these include anisomycin  cycloheximide  chloramphenicol  tetracycline  streptomycin  erythromycin  and puromycin  among othersProkaryotic ribosomes have a different structure from that of eukaryotic ribosomes and thus antibiotics can specifically target bacterial infections without any detriment to a eukaryotic hosts cells

- - what is a form of legal ownership
  - Ownership of property may be private collective or common and the property may be objects  landreal estate  or intellectual property Determining ownership in law involves determining who has certain rights and duties over the propertyThese rights and duties sometimes called a bundle of rights can be separated and held by different partiesThe question of ownership reaches back to the ancient philosophers Plato and Aristotle who held different opinions on the subjectPlato 428427 BC  348347 BC thought private property created divisive inequalities while Aristotle 384 BC  322 BC thought private property enabled people to receive the full benefit of their laborPrivate property can circumvent what is now referred to as the  tragedy of the commons  problem where people tend to degrade common property more than they do private propertyGiven a shortsighted owner however a private property system can make these tragedies worsefor example a private owner of a piece of oilrich property depending on his worldview might be more interested in shortterm financial gain than incremental use with an eye toward others concerns eg those of future generations the disenfranchised etcWhile Aristotle justified the existence of private ownership he left open questions of 1 how to allocate property between what is private and common and 2 how to allocate the private property within societyOver the millennia and across cultures what can be property and how it is regarded culturally have varied widelyOwnership is the basis for many other concepts that form the foundations of ancient and modern societies such as money  trade  debt  bankruptcy  the criminality of theft  and private vs public propertyOwnership is the key building block in the development of the capitalist socioeconomic systemAdam Smith stated that one of the sacred laws of justice was to guard a persons property and possessionsThe process and mechanics of ownership are fairly complex one can gain transfer and lose ownership of property in a number of waysTo acquire property one can purchase it with money trade it for other property receive it as a gift  steal it find it make  it or homestead itOne can transfer or lose ownership of property by selling it for money exchanging it for other property giving it as a gift being robbed of it it or having it stripped from ones ownership through legal means such as eviction  foreclosure  seizure  or taking Ownership is selfpropagating in that the owner of any property will also own the economic benefits of that property

- - what are warehouse spreadsheets used for
  - Data Warehouse OverviewIn computing  a data warehouse or enterprise data warehouse DW DWH or EDW is a database used for reporting and data analysis It is a central repository of data which is created by integrating data from one or more disparate sourcesData warehouses store current as well as historical data and are used for creating trending reports for senior management reporting such as annual and quarterly comparisonsThe data stored in the warehouse are uploaded from the operational systems such as marketing sales etc shown in the figure to the rightThe data may pass through an operational data store for additional operations before they are used in the DW for reportingThe typical ETL based data warehouse uses staging  data integration and access layers to house its key functionsThe staging layer or staging database stores raw data extracted from each of the disparate source data systemsThe integration layer integrates the disparate data sets by transforming the data from the staging layer often storing this transformed data in an operational data store ODS databaseThe integrated data are then moved to yet another database often called the data warehouse database where the data is arranged into hierarchical groups often called dimensions and into facts and aggregate factsThe combination of facts and dimensions is sometimes called a star schema The access layer helps users retrieve dataA data warehouse constructed from an integrated data source systems does not require ETL staging databases or operational data store databasesThe integrated data source systems may be considered to be a part of a distributed operational data store layerData federation methods or data virtualization methods may be used to access the distributed integrated source data systems to consolidate and aggregate data directly into the data warehouse database tablesUnlike the ETLbased data warehouse the integrated source data systems and the data warehouse are all integrated since there is no transformation of dimensional or reference dataThis integrated data warehouse architecture supports the drill down from the aggregate data of the data warehouse to the transactional data of the integrated source data systemsData warehouses can be subdivided into data marts Data marts store subsets of data from a warehouseThis definition of the data warehouse focuses on data storageThe main source of the data is cleaned transformed cataloged and made available for use by managers and other business professionals for data mining  online analytical processing  market research and decision support Marakas  OBrien 2009However the means to retrieve and analyze data to extract transform and load data and to manage the data dictionary are also considered essential components of a data warehousing systemMany references to data warehousing use this broader contextThus an expanded definition for data warehousing includes business intelligence tools  tools to extract transform and load data into the repository and tools to manage and retrieve metadata

- - what wavelengths are the most harmful on the em spectrum
  - A diagram of the electromagnetic spectrum showing various properties across the range of frequencies and wavelengthsThe electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation The electromagnetic spectrum of an object has a different meaning and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular objectThe electromagnetic spectrum extends from below the low frequencies used for modern radio communication to gamma radiation at the short wavelength highfrequency end thereby covering wavelengths from thousands of kilometers down to a fraction of the size of an atom The limit for long wavelengths is the size of the universe itself while it is thought that the short wavelength limit is in the vicinity of the Planck length  although in principle the spectrum is infinite and continuous Most parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are used in science for spectroscopic and other probing interactions as ways to study and characterize matterIn addition radiation from various parts of the spectrum has found many other uses for communications and manufacturing see electromagnetic radiation for more applicationsLegend

- - what the multiple endings of john say about its possible authorship

- - when do i plant triticale
  - Triticale  Triticosecale  is a hybrid of wheat Triticum and rye Secale first bred in laboratories during the late 19th centuryThe grain was originally bred in Scotland and Sweden Commercially available triticale is almost always a second generation hybrid ie a cross between two kinds of primary first cross triticalesAs a rule triticale combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance including soil conditions of rye Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable cropDepending on the cultivar  triticale can more or less resemble either of its parentsIt is grown mostly for forage or fodder  although some triticalebased foods can be purchased at health food stores or are to be found in some breakfast cereals When crossing wheat and rye wheat is used as the female parent and rye as the male parent pollen donorThe resulting hybrid is sterile  and must be treated with colchicine to induce polyploidy and thus the ability to reproduce itselfThe primary producers of triticale are Poland  Germany  France  Belarus and Australia In 2009 according to the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO 150 million tons were harvested in 29 countries across the worldThe triticale hybrids are all amphidiploid  which means the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from different species In other words triticale is an allotetraploid In earlier years most work was done on octoploid triticaleDifferent ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over timeThe tetraploids showed little promise but hexaploid triticale was successful enough to find commercial applicationThe CIMMYT triticale improvement program wanted to improve food production and nutrition in developing countries Triticale has potential in the production of bread and other food products such as cookies  pasta  pizza dough and breakfast cereals The protein content is higher than that of wheat  although the glutenin fraction is lessThe grain has also been stated to have higher levels of lysine than wheatAssuming increased acceptance the milling industry will have to adapt to triticale as the milling techniques employed for wheat are unsuited to triticaleSell et al found triticale could be used as a feed grain  and later research found its starch was particularly readily digestedAs a feed grain triticale is already well established and of high economic importanceIt has received attention as a potential energy crop  and research is currently being conducted on the use of the crops biomass in bioethanol production

- - what are rocker arms
  - Rocker armGenerally referred to within the context of the internal combustion engine of automotive marine motorcycle and reciprocating aviation engines the rocker arm is an oscillating lever that conveys radial movement from the cam lobe into linear movement at the poppet valve to open itOne end is raised and lowered by a rotating lobe of the camshaft either directly or via a tappet lifter and pushrod  while the other end acts on the valve stem When the camshaft lobe raises the outside of the arm the inside presses down on the valve stem opening the valveWhen the outside of the arm is permitted to return due to the camshafts rotation the inside rises allowing the valve spring to close the valveThe drive cam is driven by the camshaft This pushes the rocker arm up and down about the trunnion pin or rocker shaftFriction may be reduced at the point of contact with the valve stem by a roller cam follower A similar arrangement transfers the motion via another roller cam follower to a second rocker armThis rotates about the rocker shaft and transfers the motion via a tappet to the poppet valve In this case this opens the intake valve to the cylinder head The effective leverage of the arm and thus the force it can exert on the valve stem is determined by the rocker arm ratio the ratio of the distance from the rocker arms center of rotation to the tip divided by the distance from the center of rotation to the point acted on by the camshaft or pushrodCurrent automotive design favors rocker arm ratios of about 151 to 181However in the past smaller positive ratios the valve lift is greater than the cam lift and even negative ratios valve lift smaller than the cam lift have been usedMany preWW2 engines use 11 neutral ratiosFor car engines the rocker arms are generally steel stampings  providing a reasonable balance of strength weight and economical costBecause the rocker arms are in part reciprocating weight  excessive mass especially at the lever ends limits the engines ability to reach high operating speeds

- - what is a synthetic conduit
  - A nerve guidance conduit also referred to as an artificial nerve conduit or artificial nerve graft as opposed to an autograft  is an artificial means of guiding axonal regrowth to facilitate nerve regeneration and is one of several clinical treatments for nerve injuries When direct suturing of the two stumps of a severed nerve cannot be accomplished without tension the standard clinical treatment for peripheral nerve injuries is autologous nerve grafting Due to the limited availability of donor tissue and functional recovery in autologous nerve grafting neural tissue engineering research has focused on the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits as an alternative treatment especially for large defectsSimilar techniques are also being explored for nerve repair in the spinal cord but nerve regeneration in the central nervous system poses a greater challenge because its axons do not regenerate appreciably in their native environmentThe creation of artificial conduits is also known as entubulation because the nerve ends and intervening gap are enclosed within a tube composed of biological or synthetic materialsWhether the conduit is in the form of a biologic tube synthetic tube or tissueengineered conduit it should facilitate neurotropic and neurotrophic communication between the proximal and distal ends of the nerve gap block external inhibitory factors and provide a physical guidance for axonal regrowthThe most basic objective of a nerve guidance conduit is to combine physical chemical and biological cues under conditions that will foster tissue formationMaterials that have been used to make biologic tubes include blood vessels and skeletal muscles while nonabsorbable and bioabsorbable synthetic tubes have been made from silicone and polyglycolide respectivelyTissueengineered nerve guidance conduits are a combination of many elements scaffold structure scaffold material cellular therapies neurotrophic factors and biomimetic materialsThe choice of which physical chemical and biological cues to use is based on the properties of the nerve environment which is critical in creating the most desirable environment for axon regenerationThe factors that control material selection include biocompatibility  biodegradability mechanical integrity controllability during nerve growth implantation and sterilization

- - where did the early humans live
  - Human evolution refers to the evolutionary process leading up to the appearance of modern humans While it began with the last common ancestor of all life the topic usually covers only the evolutionary history of primates  in particular the genus Homo  and the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species of hominids or great apesThe study of human evolution involves many scientific disciplines including physical anthropology  primatology  archaeology  linguistics  evolutionary psychology  embryology and genetics According to genetic studies primates diverged from other mammals about in the Late Cretaceous period and the earliest fossils appear in the Paleocene  around The family Hominidae diverged from the Hylobatidae Gibbon family 1520 million years ago and around  the Ponginae  orangutans  diverged from the Hominidae familyBipedalism is the basic adaption of the Hominin line and the earliest bipedal Hominin is considered to be either Sahelanthropus or Orrorin  with Ardipithecus  a full bipedal coming somewhat laterThe gorilla and chimpanzee diverged around the same time about 46 million years ago and either Sahelanthropus or Orrorin may be our last shared ancestor with themThe early bipedals eventually evolved into the australopithecines and later the genus Homo The earliest documented members of the genus Homo are Homo habilis which evolved around  the earliest species for which there is positive evidence of use of stone toolsThe brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a chimpanzeeDuring the next million years a process of encephalization began and with the arrival of Homo erectus in the fossil record cranial capacity had doubled to 850 cm3Homo erectus and Homo ergaster were the first of the hominina to leave Africa and these species spread through Africa Asia and Europe between It is believed that these species were the first to use fire and complex toolsAccording to the Recent African Ancestry theory  modern humans evolved in Africa possibly from Homo heidelbergensis  Homo rhodesiensis or Homo antecessor and migrated out of the continent some 50000 to 100000 years ago replacing local populations of Homo erectus Homo denisova  Homo floresiensis and Homo neanderthalensisArchaic Homo sapiens  the forerunner of anatomically modern humans  evolved between 400000 and 250000 years agoRecent DNA evidence suggests that several haplotypes of Neanderthal origin are present among all nonAfrican populations and Neanderthals and other hominids such as Denisova hominin may have contributed up to 6 of their genome to presentday humansref name101126science1209202 Anatomically modern humans evolved from archaic Homo sapiens in the Middle Paleolithic  about 200000 years agoThe transition to behavioral modernity with the development of symbolic culture language and specialized lithic technology happened around 50000 years ago according to many anthropologists although some suggest a gradual change in behavior over a longer time span

- - where does cellular respiration occur
  - Typical eukaryotic cell Cellular respiration is the set of the metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert biochemical energy from nutrients into adenosine triphosphate ATP and then release waste productsThe reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions  which break large molecules into smaller ones releasing energy in the process as weak socalled highenergy bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the productsRespiration is one of the key ways a cell gains useful energy to fuel cellular activityCellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction The overall reaction is broken into many smaller ones when it occurs in the body most of which are redox reactions themselvesAlthough technically cellular respiration is a combustion reaction  it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cellThis difference is because it occurs in many separate stepsWhile the overall reaction is a combustion reaction no single reaction that comprises it is a combustion reactionNutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar  amino acids and fatty acids  and a common oxidizing agent  electron acceptor  is molecular oxygen O2The energy stored in ATP its third phosphate group is weakly bonded to the rest of the molecule and is cheaply broken allowing stronger bonds to form thereby transferring energy for use by the cell can then be used to drive processes requiring energy including biosynthesis  locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes

  - Earthquake prediction is usually defined as the specification of the time location and magnitude of a future earthquake within stated limits and particularly of the next strong earthquake to occur in a regionThis can be distinguished from earthquake forecasting which is the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazard including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over periods of years or decadesThis can be further distinguished from realtime earthquake warning systems  which upon detection of a severe earthquake can provide neighboring regions a few seconds warning of potentially significant shakingTo be useful an earthquake prediction must be precise enough to warrant the cost of increased precautions including disruption of ordinary activities and commerce and timely enough that preparation can be madePredictions must also be reliable as false alarms and cancelled alarms are not only economically costly but seriously undermine confidence in and thereby the effectiveness of any kind of warningWith over 7000 earthquakes around the world each year with a magnitude of 40 or greater trivial success in earthquake prediction is easily obtained using sufficiently broad parameters of time location or magnitudeHowever such trivial successful predictions are not usefulMajor earthquakes are often followed by reports that they were predicted or at least anticipated but no claim of a successful prediction of a major earthquake has survived close inquiryIn the 1970s there was intense optimism amongst scientists that some method of predicting earthquakes might be found but by the 1990s continuing failure led many scientists to question whether it was even possibleWhile many scientists still hold that given enough resources prediction might be possible many others maintain that earthquake prediction is inherently impossible

- - when did the us stop producing vacuum tubes
  - Modern vacuum tubes mostly miniature styleIn electronics  a vacuum tube electron tube in North America thermionic valve tube or valve is a device controlling electric current through a vacuum in a sealed containerThe container is often thin transparent glass in a roughly cylindrical shapeThe simplest vacuum tube the diode is essentially an incandescent light bulb with an added electrode insideWhen the bulbs filament is heated whitehot electrons are boiled off its surface and into the vacuum inside the bulbIf the electrode  called a plate or anode  is made more positive than the hot filament a direct current flows through the vacuum to the electrode a demonstration of the Edison effect As the current only flows in one direction it makes it possible to convert an alternating current applied to the filament to direct current The introduction of a third electrode a grid between the filament and the plate yields another functionA voltage applied to the grid controls the current flowing from the filament to the plateThus it allows the device to be used as an electronic amplifierVacuum tubes are thus used for rectification  amplification  switching  or similar processing or creation of electrical signals The vast majority of modern day tubes consist of a sealed container with a vacuum inside and essentially rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filamentSome exceptions to this are dealt with in the section about gasfilled tubes belowVacuum tubes were critical to the development of electronic technology which drove the expansion and commercialization of radio broadcasting television radar sound reinforcement  sound recording and reproduction  large telephone networks analog and digital computers and industrial process control Although some applications had counterparts using earlier technologies such as the spark gap transmitter or mechanical computers  it was the invention of the vacuum tube with three electrodes called a triode  and its capability of electronic amplification that made these technologies widespread and practicalIn most applications solidstate devices such as transistors and other semiconductor devices have replaced tubesSolidstate devices last longer and are smaller more efficient more reliable and cheaper than tubesTubes can be fragile sometimes generate significant unwanted heat and can take many secondsmany minutes in critical applicationsafter powering on to warm to a temperature where they perform within operational toleranceHowever tubes still find uses where solidstate devices have not been developed are impractical or where a tube has superior performance as with some devices in professional audio and highpower radio transmittersTubes are still produced for such applicationsTubes are less likely than semiconductor devices to be destroyed by the electromagnetic pulse produced by nuclear explosions and geomagnetic storms produced by giant solar flares

- - what are square diamonds called
  - Princess cut diamond set in a ringThe Princess cut is the second most popular cut shape for diamonds  next to a round brilliant The faceup shape of the princess cut is square or rectangular and the profile or sideon shape is similar to that of an inverted pyramid with four beveled sidesThe princess cut is a relatively new diamond cut having been created in the 1960sIt has gained in popularity in recent years as a more distinctive alternative to the more popular round brilliant cut  in which the top of diamond called the crown is cut with a round faceup shape and the bottom called the pavilion is shaped similar to a cone A princess cut with the same width as the diameter of a round brilliant will weigh more as it has four corners which would otherwise have been cut off and rounded to form a round brilliantThe princess cut is sometimes referred to as a square modified brilliantHowever while displaying the same high degree of brilliance its faceting style is unique and completely different from that of a round brilliantThe Princess cut had its origins in the early French cut having a stepmodified DoubleFrench or Cross cut crown and a series of unique chevronshaped facets in the pavilion which combine to give a distinct crossshaped reflection when the stone is viewed directly through the tableEffectively the Princess cut combines the high degree of light return of a round brilliant cut with a distinctive square or rectangular shapeThe square princess cut diamond is usually slightly cheaper than round brilliant cut diamonds of the same carat weight because it retains about 80 of the rough diamond as opposed to the round brilliant which retains only about 50 of the roughThe ability to retain more crystal weight makes this shape popular amongst diamond cuttersAccredited Gem Appraisers AGA and American Gem Society Laboratory AGSL and European Gem LaboratoriesUSA EGLUSA are currently the only labs that grade the Princess cut for cutThere is no universal definition of what measurements make an ideal princess cut diamond and many diamond manufacturers market ideal diamonds with differing facet patterns and angles as ideal cutIn contrast to the AGSL AGA and EGLUSA the Gemological Institute of America GIA has stated that there is not enough industry consensus or empirical data to specify cut grading standards for Princess cut diamonds and to do so is at the risk of consumers who may be deceived by diamonds accompanied by unqualified Ideal or Excellent cut gradesThe name Princess Cut was originally used in connection with another diamond cut otherwise known as the Profile cut designed by Arpad Nagy a London cutter in 1961The same name was later used and made popular by Ygal Perlman Betzalel Ambar and Israel Itzkowitz in Israel in 1979A similar cut with only 49 facets as opposed to the original 58 facets of the princess cut was later branded the Quadrillion and initially distributed by Ambar Diamonds in Los AngelesThree years of optical research yielded a square stone with faceting similar to that of a round brilliant cut diamondA ComparisonThe number of chevrons can affect the overall outlook of a princess cut diamondThis can usually be determined by the wire diagram that is plotted in diamond grading reportsBy adding more chevrons on the pavilion side of the diamond the individual facets of the diamond will now be broken down into smaller facetsAs a result it can give a princess cut diamond a crushed ice lookVice versa when a princess cut diamond has lesser chevrons it tends to give the diamond a chunky outlook due to broader facets

- - when a cell divides
  - Three types of cell divisionCell division is the process by which a parent cell divides into two or more daughter cellsCell division usually occurs as part of a larger cell cycle In eukaryotes  there are two distinct type of cell division a vegetative division whereby each daughter cell is genetically identical to the parent cell  mitosis  and a reductive cell division whereby the number of chromosomes in the daughter cells is reduced by half to produce haploid gametes  meiosis Both of these cell division cycles are required in sexually reproducing organisms at some point in their life cycle and both are believed to be present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor Prokaryotes also undergo a vegetative cell division known as binary fission  where their genetic material is segregated equally into two daughter cellsAll cell divisions regardless of organism are preceded by a single round of DNA replication For simple unicellular organisms such as the amoeba  one cell division is equivalent to reproduction  an entire new organism is createdOn a larger scale mitotic cell division can create progeny from multicellular organisms such as plants that grow from cuttingsCell division also enables sexually reproducing organisms to develop from the onecelled zygote  which itself was produced by cell division from gametes And after growth cell division allows for continual construction and repair of the organismA human beings body experiences about 10000 trillion cell divisions in a lifetimeCell division has been modeled by finite subdivision rules The primary concern of cell division is the maintenance of the original cells genome Before division can occur the genomic information that is stored in chromosomes must be replicated and the duplicated genome must be separated cleanly between cellsA great deal of cellular infrastructure is involved in keeping genomic information consistent between generations

- - when did mass unemployment start
  - upright115Unemployment or joblessness occurs when people are without work and actively seeking workThe unemployment rate is a measure of the prevalence of unemployment and it is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by all individuals currently in the labor force During periods of recession  an economy usually experiences a relatively high unemployment rateAccording to International Labour Organization report more than 197 million people globally are out of work or 6 of the worlds workforce were without a job in 2012There remains considerable theoretical debate regarding the causes consequences and solutions for unemploymentClassical economics  New classical economics  and the Austrian School of economics argue that market mechanisms are reliable means of resolving unemploymentThese theories argue against interventions imposed on the labor market from the outside such as unionization minimum wage laws  taxes and other regulations that they claim discourage the hiring of workersKeynesian economics emphasizes the cyclical nature of unemployment and recommends government interventions in the economy that it claims will reduce unemployment during recessionsThis theory focuses on recurrent shocks that suddenly reduce aggregate demand for goods and services and thus reduce demand for workersKeynesian models recommend government interventions designed to increase demand for workers these can include financial stimuli publicly funded job creation and expansionist monetary policiesIn addition to these comprehensive theories of unemployment there are a few categorizations of unemployment that are used to more precisely model the effects of unemployment within the economic systemThe main types of unemployment include structural unemployment which focuses on structural problems in the economy and inefficiencies inherent in labour markets including a mismatch between the supply and demand of laborers with necessary skill setsStructural arguments emphasize causes and solutions related to disruptive technologies and globalization Discussions of frictional unemployment focus on voluntary decisions to work based on each individuals valuation of their own work and how that compares to current wage rates plus the time and effort required to find a jobCauses and solutions for frictional unemployment often address job entry threshold and wage ratesBehavioral economists highlight individual biases in decision making and often involve problems and solutions concerning sticky wages and efficiency wages

- - what are dialysis tubes
  - Dialysis tubingDialysis tubing is a type of semi or partially permeable membrane tubing made from regenerated cellulose or cellophane It can be used for diffusion with solutes or osmosis if used with water onlyOsmosis is when water passes through a semipermeable layer to reach equilibriumDiffusion on the other hand allows the movement of molecules from high concentration to low concentrationIt will only allow molecules to pass through a semipermeable membrane or layer if the molecule is small enough to fit through the membrane or a membranes poreThis usually results with the effects of diffusion through a membrane only really affects small molecules and almost never larger moleculesDialysis tubing is used in clinical circumstances to ensure a filtered flow of molecules preventing the flow of larger solute moleculesSmall molecules can be washed out of a solution which is pumped through the tubing into a solvent usually water  which surrounds it and in which they can be flushed awayIn demonstrations of semipermeable membranes a solution containing several types of molecules usually glucose and starch  is placed into a semipermeable dialysis bag such as a cellulose membrane with pores and the bag is sealed with a knot or elastic bandThe sealed dialysis bag is placed in a container of a different solution or waterMolecules small enough to pass through the tubing water salts monosaccharides  and other small molecules tend to move into or out of the dialysis bag in the direction of decreasing concentration therefore displaying diffusionLarger molecules such as proteins  or polysaccharides  that have dimensions significantly greater than the pore diameter are retained inside the dialysis bagThe water and smaller solutes in a hypotonic solution a solution that has a lesser solute concentration than the solution it is referenced to will cross a semipermeable membrane like dialysis tubing into a hypertonic solution a solution that has a higher solute concentration than the solution it is referenced to in an attempt to reach equilibrium where the solute concentration of each solution is in equilibrium

- - who rules communism government
  - Map of countries that declared themselves to be socialist states under the MarxistLeninist or Maoist definition  that is to say Communist states  between 1979 and 1983This period marked the greatest territorial extent of Communist statesA communist state is a state where the means of production are collectively owned by the societyIt has a form of government characterized by singleparty rule or dominantparty rule of a communist party referred as Dictatorship of the Proletariat by its proponents and a professed allegiance to a Leninist or MarxistLeninist ideology as the guiding principle of the stateTechnically communist state is a contradictio in terminis as a communist society as defined by both Marxists and anarchocommunists is in principle statelessFrom this perspective the term MarxistLeninist state is more appropriateHistorically a communist state referred to a system where public ownership of all or most means of production by the Communist party run state is deemed necessary to further the interests of the working class  today a communist state can also for instance refer to contemporary China and Vietnam where a Communist Partyrun state exists alongside a mixed economy According to MarxistLeninists the state is a tool in the hands of the ruling class  which in a socialist society is the working class so a socialist state is according to Leninists a state of the working class In practice communist states do not actually refer to themselves as suchThey do this not to disguise the fact that the ruling party is communist but rather because they do not consider themselves to be a communist society at presentInstead they constitutionally identify themselves as socialist states or workers statesThe primary goal of these states which also explains their official name is to guide their respective countries in the process of building socialism  ultimately leading to communismCommunist states may have several legal political parties  but the communist party is usually granted a special or dominant role in government often by statute or under the constitutionConsequently the institutions of the state and of the communist party become intimately entwined such as in the development of parallel institutionsIn the 20th century most communist states adopted planned economies However there were exceptions The Soviet Union during the 1920s and late 1980s and Yugoslavia after World War II allowed limited markets and a degree of worker selfmanagement while China  Vietnam and Laos introduced farreaching market reforms after the 1980sIn the 21st century China and Vietnam have allowed a mixed economy to developThe fundamental concepts of communist states often diverge from the original socioeconomic ideologies from which they developAs a result many adherents of these ideologies often oppose the political systems commonly associated with these statesFor example dissenting communists such as Trotskyists were often opposed to the communist states of the 20th century claiming either that they had nothing to do with real communism or that the ideology of such states had reached a point of irrevocable corruption

  - Slug is a common name for an apparently shellless terrestrial gastropod mollusk The word slug is also often used as part of the common name of any gastropod mollusc that has no shell has a very reduced shell or has only a small internal shellThis is in contrast to the common name  snail  which is applied to gastropods that have a coiled shell that is large enough that the soft parts of the animal can retract fully into itSlugs exist on land and in the sea and there is even one genus of freshwater slugs Acochlidium The unadorned word slug is however applied primarily to land slugs whereas slugs from the sea or from freshwater are usually referred to as  sea slugs  and freshwater slugsLand gastropods with a shell that is not quite vestigial  but is too small to retract into like many in the family Urocyclidae  are known as semislugs The various taxonomic families of slugs form part of several quite different evolutionary lineages which also include snailsThus for example the various families of land slugs are not very closely related to one another despite a superficial similarity in the overall body formThe shellless condition has arisen many times independently during the evolutionary past and thus the category slug is emphatically a polyphyletic oneSlugs like all other gastropods undergo torsion a 180 twisting of the internal organs during developmentInternally slug anatomy clearly shows the effects of this rotation but externally the bodies of land slugs appear to be more or less symmetrical except for the positioning of the pneumostome  which is on one side of the animal normally the right hand sideThe soft slimy bodies of slugs are prone to desiccation  so landliving slugs are confined to moist environments and must retreat to damp hiding places when the weather is dryThe subsequent information in this article applies to land slugs

- - where do you find iodine
  - Iodine is a chemical element with symbol I and atomic number 53The name is from Greek ioeids meaning violet or purple due to the color of elemental iodine vaporIodine and its compounds are primarily used in nutrition  and industrially in the production of acetic acid and certain polymers Iodines relatively high atomic number low toxicity  and ease of attachment to organic compounds have made it a part of many Xray contrast materials in modern medicineIodine has only one stable isotope A number of iodine radioisotopes are also used in medical applicationsIodine is found on Earth mainly as the highly watersoluble iodide ion I which concentrates it in oceans and brine pools Like the other halogens  free iodine occurs mainly as a diatomic molecule I2 and then only momentarily after being oxidized from iodide by an oxidant like free oxygenIn the universe and on Earth iodines high atomic number makes it a relatively rare element However its presence in ocean water has given it a role in biologyIt is the heaviest essential element utilized widely by life in biological functions only tungsten  employed in enzymes by a few species of bacteria is heavierIodines rarity in many soils due to initial low abundance as a crustelement and also leaching of soluble iodide by rainwater has led to many deficiency problems in land animals and inland human populationsIodine deficiency affects about two billion people and is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disabilities Iodine is required by higher animals which use it to synthesize thyroid hormones  which contain the elementBecause of this function radioisotopes of iodine are concentrated in the thyroid gland along with nonradioactive iodineIf inhaled the radioisotope iodine131  which has a high fission product yield  concentrates in the thyroid but is easily remedied with potassium iodide treatment
- - what are lobbying groups
  - Lobbying also lobby is the act of attempting to influence decisions made by officials in the government  most often legislators or members of regulatory agencies Lobbying is done by many different types of people and organized groups including individuals in the private sector  corporations  fellow legislators or government officials or advocacy groups interest groupsLobbyists may be among a legislators constituencies meaning a voter or bloc of voters within his or her electoral district  or not they may engage in lobbying as a business or notProfessional lobbyists are people whose business is trying to influence legislation on behalf of a group or individual who hires themIndividuals and nonprofit organizations can also lobby as an act of volunteering or as a small part of their normal job for instance a CEO meeting with a representative about a project important to hisher company or an activist meeting with hisher legislator in an unpaid capacityGovernments often define and regulate organized group lobbying that has become influentialThe ethics and morality of lobbying are Lobbying is often spoken of with contempt when the implication is that people with inordinate socioeconomic power are corrupting the law twisting it away from fairness in order to serve their own conflict of interest But another side of lobbying is making sure that others interests are duly defended against others corruption  or even simply making sure that minority interests are fairly defended against mere tyranny of the majority For example a medical association  or a trade association of health insurance companies may lobby a legislature in order to counteract the influence of tobacco companies in which case the lobbying would be viewed by most people as justified duly defending against others corruptionThe difficulty in drawing objective lines between which lobbyists are good lobbyists and which ones are bad ones is compounded by the cleverness with which lobbyists or their clients can argue that their own lobbying is of the good kindAt heart the effort to influence legislation is a power struggleAs in other forms of power struggle such as war or law enforcement  motives range from to selfdefense to fighting for justice  and the dividing line between predation and justice is subject to rationalization

- - when editing precision means
  - Accuracy indicates proximity of measurement results to the true value precision to the repeatability or reproducibility of the measurementIn the fields of science  engineering  industry  and statistics  the accuracy of a measurement system is the degree of closeness of measurements of a quantity to that quantitys actual true value The precision of a measurement system also called reproducibility or repeatability  is the degree to which repeated measurements under unchanged conditions show the same results Although the two words reproducibility and repeatability can be synonymous in colloquial use they are deliberately contrasted in the context of the scientific method A measurement system can be accurate but not precise precise but not accurate neither or bothFor example if an experiment contains a systematic error  then increasing the sample size generally increases precision but does not improve accuracyThe result would be a consistent yet inaccurate string of results from the flawed experimentEliminating the systematic error improves accuracy but does not change precisionA measurement system is designated valid if it is both accurate and preciseRelated terms include bias non random or directed effects caused by a factor or factors unrelated to the independent variable  and error random variabilityThe terminology is also applied to indirect measurementsthat is values obtained by a computational procedure from observed dataIn addition to accuracy and precision measurements may also have a measurement resolution  which is the smallest change in the underlying physical quantity that produces a response in the measurementIn the case of full reproducibility such as when rounding a number to a representable floating point number the word precision has a meaning not related to reproducibilityFor example in the IEEE 7542008 standard it means the number of bits in the significand  so it is used as a measure for the relative accuracy with which an arbitrary number can be represented

- - What is the first program to run during a system boot sequence
  - In computing  booting also known as booting up is the initial set of operations that a computer system performs when electrical power to the CPU is switched onThe process begins when a computer is turned on for the first time or is reenergized after being turned off and ends when the computer is ready to perform its normal operationsOn modern general purpose computers this can take tens of seconds and typically involves performing a poweron selftest  locating and initializing peripheral devices and then finding loading and starting an operating system Many computer systems also allow these operations to be initiated by a software command without cycling power in what is known as a soft reboot  though some of the initial operations might be skipped on a soft rebootA boot loader is a computer program that loads the main operating system or runtime environment for the computer after completion of the selftestsThe computer term boot is short for bootstrap or bootstrap load and derives from the phrase to pull oneself up by ones bootstraps The usage calls attention to the requirement that if most software is loaded onto a computer by other software already running on the computer some mechanism must exist to load initial software onto the computerEarly computers used a variety of adhoc methods to get a small program into memory to solve this problemThe invention of integrated circuit readonly memory ROM of various types solved this paradox by allowing computers to be shipped with a start up program that could not be erasedGrowth in the capacity of ROM has allowed ever more elaborate start up procedures to be implementedOn general purpose computers the boot process begins with the execution of an initial program stored in boot ROMs or read in another fashionIn some older computers the initial program might have been the application to run if no operating system was used or the operating systemIn other computers the initial program is a boot loader that may then load into randomaccess memory RAM from nonvolatile secondary storage such as a hard disk drive  or in some older computers from a medium such as punched cards  punched tape  or magnetic tape in older computers the binary code of an operating system or runtime environment and then execute itIf the boot loader is limited in its size and capabilities it may instead load a larger and more capable secondary boot loader which would then load the operating system or runtime environmentSome embedded systems do not require a noticeable boot sequence to begin functioning and when turned on may simply run operational programs that are stored in ROM

- - What is the main disadvantage of using algorithms
  - Visualization of links between pages on a wiki using a forcedirected layoutForcedirected graph drawing algorithms are a class of algorithms for drawing graphs in an aesthetically pleasing wayTheir purpose is to position the nodes of a graph in twodimensional or threedimensional space so that all the edges are of more or less equal length and there are as few crossing edges as possible by assigning forces among the set of edges and the set of nodes based on their relative positions and then using these forces either to simulate the motion of the edges and nodes or to minimize their energyWhile graph drawing can be a difficult problem forcedirected algorithms being physical simulations usually require no special knowledge about graph theory such as planarity 
- - what is lost purchasing power

  - Sphagnum is a genus of between 1510 and 3500 species of mosses  commonly called peat moss due to its prevalence in wet habitats where it contributes to the formation of peat bogs and miresSphagnum accumulations can store water since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells plants may hold from 1626 times as much water as their dry weight depending on the speciesThe empty cells help retain water in drier conditionsHence as sphagnum moss grows it can slowly spread into drier conditions forming larger peatlands both raised bogs and blanket bogsThese peat accumulations then provide habitat for a wide array of peatland plants including sedges and ericaceous shrubs as well as orchids and carnivorous plantsSphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the mosss cell walls In addition bogs like all wetlands develop anaerobic soil conditions which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial actionPeat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations  such as calcium and magnesium  and releasing hydrogen ionsUnder the right conditions peat can accumulate to a depth of many metersDifferent species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH so any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum speciesIndividual peat moss plants consist of a main stem with tightly arranged clusters of branch fascicles usually consisting of two or three spreading branches and two to four hanging branchesThe top of the plant or capitulum has compact clusters of young branchesAlong the stem are scattered leaves of various shapes named stem leaves the shape varies according to speciesThe leaves consist of two kinds of cells small green living cells  chlorophyllose cells and large clear structural dead cells  hyaline cellsThe latter have the large waterholding capacity

- - what is vitamin a for
  - Vitamin A is a group of nutritionally unsaturated hydrocarbons which include retinol retinal retinoic acid and several provitamin A carotenoids among which betacarotene is the most importantVitamin A has multiple functions it is important for growth and development for the maintenance of the immune system and good visionVitamin A is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of retinal  which combines with protein opsin to form rhodopsin the lightabsorbing molecule  that is necessary for both lowlight  scotopic vision and color vision Vitamin A also functions in a very different role as an irreversibly oxidized form of retinol known as retinoic acid  which is an important hormonelike growth factor for epithelial and other cellsIn foods of animal origin the major form of vitamin A is an ester  primarily retinyl palmitate  which is converted to retinol chemically an alcohol  in the small intestineThe retinol form functions as a storage form of the vitamin and can be converted to and from its visually active aldehyde form retinal The associated acid retinoic acid a metabolite that can be irreversibly synthesized from vitamin A has only partial vitamin A activity and does not function in the retina for the visual cycleRetinoic acid is used for growth and cellular differentiationAll forms of vitamin A have a betaionone ring to which an isoprenoid chain is attached called a retinyl groupBoth structural features are essential for vitamin activityThe orange pigment of carrots  betacarotene  can be represented as two connected retinyl groups which are used in the body to contribute to vitamin A levelsAlphacarotene and gammacarotene also have a single retinyl group which give them some vitamin activityNone of the other carotenes have vitamin activityThe carotenoid beta cryptoxanthin possesses an ionone group and has vitamin activity in humansVitamin A can be found in two principal forms in foods Retinol  the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources is a yellow fatsoluble substanceSince the pure alcohol form is unstable the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl esterIt is also commercially produced and administered as esters such as retinyl acetate or palmitate The carotenes alphacarotene betacarotene gammacarotene and the xanthophyll betacryptoxanthin all of which contain betaionone rings but no other carotenoids  function as provitamin A in herbivores and omnivore animals which possess the enzyme 1515dioxygenase which cleaves betacarotene in the intestinal mucosa and converts it retinolIn general carnivores are poor converters of ioninecontaining carotenoids and pure carnivores such as cats and ferrets lack 1515dioxygenase and cannot convert any carotenoids to retinal resulting in none of the carotenoids being forms of vitamin A for these species

- - where is vitamin d found
  - Vitamin D is a group of fatsoluble secosteroids responsible for intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphateIn humans the most important related compounds of vitamin D are vitamin D2 and vitamin D3Cholecalciferol vitamin D3 and ergocalciferol vitamin D2 are unique as they constitute what we know as vitamin D and can be ingested from the diet andor supplementsThe body can also synthesize vitamin D from cholesterol when sun exposure is adequate hence its nickname the sunshine vitaminAlthough vitamin D is commonly called a vitamin it is not actually an essential dietary vitamin in the strict sense as it can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sunlightCats and dogs cannot synthesize vitamin D efficiently and must receive it in their dietAn organic chemical compound or related set of compounds is only scientifically called a vitamin when it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism and must be obtained from their dietHowever as with other compounds commonly called vitamins vitamin D was discovered in an effort to find the dietary substance that was lacking in a disease namely rickets  the childhood form of osteomalacia Additionally like other compounds called vitamins in the developed world vitamin D is added to staple foods such as milk to avoid disease due to deficiencyMeasures of serum levels reflect endogenous synthesis from exposure to sunlight as well as intake from the diet and it is believed that synthesis may contribute generally to the maintenance of adequate serum concentrationsThe evidence indicates that the synthesis of vitamin D from sun exposure works in a feedback loop that prevents toxicity but because of uncertainty about the cancer risk from sunlight no recommendations are issued by the Institute of Medicine  USA for the amount of sun exposure required to meet vitamin D requirementsAccordingly the Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D assume that no synthesis occurs and that all of a persons vitamin D is from their diet although that will rarely occur in practiceIn the liver vitamin D is converted to calcidiol  which is also known as calcifediol INN 25hydroxycholecalciferol or 25hydroxyvitamin Dabbreviated 25OHD and which is the specific vitamin D metabolite that is measured in serum to determine a persons vitamin D statusPart of the calcidiol is converted by the kidneys to calcitriol  the biologically active form of vitamin D Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of boneCalcidiol is also converted to calcitriol outside of the kidneys for other purposes such as the proliferation differentiation and apoptosis of cells calcitriol also affects neuromuscular function and inflammationBeyond its use to prevent osteomalacia or rickets  the evidence for other health effects of vitamin D supplementation in the general population is inconsistentThe best evidence of benefit is for bone health and a decrease in mortality in elderly women

- - who was the first to argue that the sun was the center of the universe
  - Andreas Cellarius s illustration of the Copernican system from the Harmonia Macrocosmica 1660Heliocentrism or heliocentricism is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around a relatively stationary Sun at the center of the Solar System The word comes from the Greek  helios sun and kentron centerHistorically heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism  which placed the Earth at the centerThe notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos  but Aristarchuss heliocentrism attracted little attention until Copernicus revived and elaborated itLucio Russo  however argues that this is a misleading impression resulting from the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic EraUsing indirect evidence he argues that a heliocentric view was expounded in Hipparchus s work on gravityIt was not until the 16th century that a fully predictive mathematical model of a heliocentric system was presented by the Renaissance mathematician astronomer and Catholic cleric Nicolaus Copernicus of Poland leading to the Copernican Revolution In the following century Johannes Kepler elaborated upon and expanded this model to include elliptical orbits and supporting observations made using a telescope were presented by Galileo Galilei With the observations of William Herschel  Friedrich Bessel  and others astronomers realized that the sun was not the center of the universe and by the 1920s Edwin Hubble had shown that it was part of a galaxy the Milky Way  that was only one of many billions

- - What were the major economic activities of the early Canadians
  - Canadian historians until the 1980s tended to focus on economic history including labour historyIn part this is because Canada has had far fewer political or military conflicts than other societiesThis was especially true in the first half of the twentieth century when economic history was overwhelmingly dominantMany of the most prominent English Canadian historians from this period were economic historians such as Harold Innis  Donald Creighton and Arthur R M LowerScholars of Canadian history were heirs to the traditions that developed in Europe and the United States but frameworks that worked well elsewhere often failed in CanadaThe heavily Marxist influenced economic history that dominates Europe has little relevance to most of Canadian historyA focus on class  urban areas and industry fails to address Canadas rural and resource based economySimilarly the monetarist school that is dominant in the United States also has been difficult to transfer north of the borderThe study of economic history in Canada became highly focused on economic geography  and for many years the dominant school of thought has been the staples thesis This school of thought bases the study of the Canadian economy on the study of natural resources This approach has since also become used outside of Canada in Australia and in many developing nationsBefore the arrival of Europeans the First Nations of what would become Canada had a large and vibrant trade networkFurs  tools  decorative items and other goods were often transported thousands of kilometres mostly by canoe throughout the many rivers and lakes of the regionThe early European history of the Canadian economy is usually studied through the staples thesis which argues the Canadian economy developed through the exploitation of a series of staples that would be exported to Europe

- - what is the mortality rate for lightning strikes
  - Lightning is a highly visible form of energy transferLightning strikes are electrical discharges on a massive scale between the atmosphere and an earthbound objectThey mostly originate in thunderclouds and terminate on the ground called Cloud to Ground CG lightningHowever they may also be initiated from a very tall grounded object and reach into the cloudsAlthough a lightning strike is commonly used to describe all lightning it is rather erroneous and a misnomer as only about 25 of all lightning events worldwide are CG the large bulk of lightning events are Intracloud IC or Cloud to Cloud CC where discharge only occurs high in the atmosphereThe scientific name for the complete process of a single lightning event is a and it is a very complex multiple stepped interaction which is not completely understoodMost CG flashes only strike one physical location referred to as a terminationThe primary conducting channel the bright coursing light you may see and call a strike is only about 1 inch in diameter although to our eyes it looks much largerThey are miles long upwards of tens of milesAnd the entire flash lasts only a few fractions of a second most of which is not visible to human eyesThunder is always produced by lightningJust like lightning that deceives our eyes usually looking larger or closer than it really is the earths atmosphere and our brains perception of the outside world ultimately determines whether it is heard or notLightning cannot happen in a vacuum devoid of ions nor can thunder occur without molecules to vibrateThunder is a physical absolute for every single flash of lightningContrary to popular belief a lightning strike itself is usually not responsible for multiple deaths or injuries from a single eventIt would be impossible given the natural tendencies of a flash unless people or animals were stacked on top of each other or they were somehow arranged vertically and part of the flash channelWhen lightning ignites an available fuel source and an explosion occurs it is the shock wave or fire causing the injuries not the strike itselfGround Currents also called step potential of an earth termination is what truly causes most injuries or death to humans and animalsThe near instantaneous rush of surface charges induced by the overhead thundercloud itself race to the strike point from hundreds to thousands of feet away during dischargeThis current caused during each stroke takes the path of least resistance which may be ion rich human or animal legs over poorly conducting earthThis is why it is best to crouch with feet close together if ever caught in the open during a thunderstormUnfortunately most reports do not draw a distinction between the real cause of injury or death be it the strike itself a resulting explosion or fire or usually responsible step potential

- - what is the name for the oldest island in the hawaiian hot spots
  - The Hawaii hotspot is a volcanic hotspot located near the namesake Hawaiian Islands  in the northern Pacific Ocean One of the most wellknown and heavily studied hotspots in the world the Hawaii plume is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian  Emperor seamount chain  an over 5800 kilometres 3600 mi long chain of volcanoes four of which are active  two of which are dormant  and more than 123 of which are extinct  many having since been ground beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls The chain extends from south of the island of Hawaii to the edge of the Aleutian Trench  near the eastern edge of Russia While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries the Hawaii hotspot is located far from nearby plate boundaries the classic hotspot theory first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson  proposes that a single fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate  become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of yearsAccording to this theory the nearly 60 bend separating the Emperor and Hawaiian segments of the chain was caused by a sudden shift in the movement of the Pacific PlateIn 2003 fresh investigations of this irregularity led to the proposal of a mobile hotspot theory suggesting that hotspots are mobile not fixed and that the 47 million year old bend was caused by a shift in the hotspots motion rather than the platesAncient Hawaiians were the first to recognize the increasing age and weathered state of the volcanoes to the north as they progressed on fishing expeditions along the islandsThe volatile state of the Hawaiian volcanoes and their constant battle with the sea was a major element in Hawaiian mythology  embodied in Pele  the deity of volcanoesAfter the arrival of Europeans on the island in 18801881 James Dwight Dana directed the first formal geological study of the hotspots volcanics confirming the relationship long observed by the natives1912 marked the founding of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory by volcanologist Thomas Jaggar  initiating continuous scientific observation of the islandsIn the 1970s a mapping project was initiated to gain more information about the complex geology of Hawaiis seafloorThe hotspot has since been tomographically imaged showing it to be wide and up to deep and olivine and garnet based studies have shown its magma chamber is approximately In its at least 85 million years of activity the hotspot has produced an estimated of rockThe chains rate of drift has slowly increased over time causing the amount of time each individual volcano is active to decrease from 18 million years for the 76 million year old Detroit Seamount  to just under 900000 for the one million yearold Kohala  on the other hand eruptive volume has increased from per year to about Overall this has caused a trend towards more active but quicklysilenced closely spaced volcanoeswhereas volcanoes on the near side of the hotspot overlap each other forming such superstructures as Hawaii island and the ancient Maui Nui  the oldest of the Emperor seamounts are spaced as far as apart

- - when were forever stamps introduced
  - The main components of a stamp1 Image2 Perforations3 Denomination4 Country nameA postage stamp is a small piece of paper that is purchased and displayed on an item of mail as evidence of payment of postageTypically stamps are made from special paper  with a national designation and denomination price on the face and a gum adhesive on the reverse sidePostage stamps are purchased from a postal administration or other authorized vendor and are used to pay for the costs involved in moving mail as well as other business necessities such as insurance and registrationThe stamps shape is usually that of a small rectangle of varying proportions though triangles or other shapes are occasionally usedThe stamp is affixed to an envelope or other postal cover ie packet box mailing cylinder that the customer wishes to sendThe item is then processed by the postal system where a postmark  sometimes known as a cancellation mark is usually applied over the stamp and cover this procedure marks the stamp as used which prevents its reuseThe postmark indicates the date and point of origin of the mailingThe mailed item is then delivered to the address that the customer has applied to the envelope or coverPostage stamps have facilitated the delivery of mail since the 1840sBefore this time ink and handstamps hence the word stamp usually made from wood or cork were often used to frank the mail and confirm the payment of postageThe first adhesive postage stamp commonly referred to as the Penny Black  was issued in the United Kingdom in 1840The invention of the stamp was a part of the attempt to reform and improve the postal system in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland  which in the early 19th century was in disarray and rife with corruptionThere are varying accounts of the inventor or inventors of the stampBefore the introduction of postage stamps mail in the UK was paid for by the recipient a system that was associated with an irresolvable problem the costs of delivering mail were not recoverable by the postal service when recipients were unable or unwilling to pay for delivered items and senders had no incentive to restrict the number size or weight of items sent whether or not they would ultimately be paid forThe postage stamp resolved this issue in a simple and elegant manner with the additional benefit of room for an element of beauty to be introducedLater related inventions include postal stationery such as prepaidpostage envelopes post cards  lettercards  aerogrammes and wrappers  postage meters  and more recently specialty boxes and envelopes provided free to the customer by the US postal service for priority or express mailingThe postage stamp afforded convenience for both the mailer and postal officials more efficiently recovered costs for the postal service and ultimately resulted in a better faster postal systemWith the conveniences stamps offered their use resulted in greatly increased mailings during the 19th and 20th centuriesPostage stamps during this era were the most popular way of paying for mail but by the end of the 20th century were rapidly being eclipsed by the use of metered postage and bulk mailing by businessesThe same result with respect to communications by private parties occurred over the last decade of the 20th century and the first decade of the 21st due to declining cost of long distance telephone communications and the development and explosive spread of electronic mailing email via the Internet and bill paying systems hadAs postage stamps with their engraved imagery began to appear on a widespread basis historians and collectors began to take noticeThe study of postage stamps and their use is referred to as philately Stamp collecting can be both a hobby and a form of historical study and reference as governmentissued postage stamps and their mailing systems have always been involved with the history of nations

- - what is water jet propulsion
  - A rider on a Yamaha Waverunner XL performing a highspeed turnA jetboat is a boat propelled by a jet of water ejected from the back of the craftUnlike a powerboat or motorboat that uses a propeller in the water below or behind the boat a jetboat draws the water from under the boat into a pump inside the boat then expels it through a nozzle at the stern Jetboats were originally designed by Sir William Hamilton who developed a waterjet in 1954 for operation in the fastflowing and shallow rivers of New Zealand  specifically to overcome the problem of propellers striking rocks in such watersPrevious attempts at waterjet propulsion had very short lifetimes generally due to the inefficient design of the units and the fact that they offered few advantages over conventional propellersUnlike these previous waterjet developments such as Campinis and the Hanley Hydrojet Hamilton had a specific need for a propulsion system to operate in veryshallow water and the waterjet proved to be the ideal solutionFrom this the popularity of the jet unit and jetboat increased rapidlyThrough further developments it was found the waterjet offered several other advantages over propellers for a wide range of vessel types and as such waterjets are used widely today for many highspeed vessels including passenger ferries rescue craft patrol boats and offshore supply vesselsJetboats are highly maneuverable and many can from full speed be reversed and brought to a stop within little more than their own length in a maneuver known as a crash stopThe well known Hamilton turn or jet spin is a highspeed maneuvre where the boats engine throttle is cut the steering is turned sharply and the throttle opened again causing the boat to spin quickly around with a large spray of waterThere is no engineering limit to the size of jetboats though the validity of their use depends a lot on the type of applicationClassic propdrives are generally more efficient and economical at low speeds up to about  but as boat speed increases beyond this the extra hull resistance generated by struts rudders  shafts etc means waterjets are more efficient in the 2050 knot range up to Also in situations with very large propellers turning at slow speeds such as tug boats the equivalent size waterjet would be too big to be practicalFor these reasons the vast majority of waterjet units are installed in highspeed vessels and in particular situations where shallow draught maneuverability and load flexibility are main concernsThe biggest jetdriven vessels are found in military use or the highspeed passengercar ferry industrySouth Africas s approximately long are the biggest jetpropelled vessels so farEven these Germanbuilt vessels are capable of performing crash stops

- - what is genetic differences
  - A graphical representation of the ideal human karyotypeMitochondrial DNAHuman genetic variation is the genetic differences both within and among populations There may be multiple variants of any given gene in the human population genes leading to polymorphism Many genes are not polymorphic meaning that only a single allele is present in the population the gene is then said to be fixed No two humans are genetically identicalEven monozygotic twins  who develop from one zygote have infrequent genetic differences due to mutations occurring during development and gene copy number variation Differences between individuals even closely related individuals are the key to techniques such as genetic fingerprinting Alleles occur at different frequencies in different human populations with populations that are more geographically and ancestrally remote tending to differ more Causes of differences between individuals include the exchange of genes during meiosis and various mutational eventsThere are at least two reasons why genetic variation exists between populationsNatural selection may confer an adaptive advantage to individuals in a specific environment if an allele provides a competitive advantageAlleles under selection are likely to occur only in those geographic regions where they confer an advantageThe second main cause of genetic variation is due to the high degree of neutrality of most mutations Most mutations do not appear to have any selective effect one way or the other on the organismThe main cause is genetic drift  this is the effect of random changes in the gene poolIn humans founder effect and past small population size increasing the likelihood of genetic drift may have had an important influence in neutral differences between populationsThe theory that humans recently migrated out of Africa supports thisThe study of human genetic variation has both evolutionary significance and medical applicationsIt can help scientists understand ancient human population migrations as well as how different human groups are biologically related to one anotherFor medicine study of human genetic variation may be important because some diseasecausing alleles occur more often in people from specific geographic regionsNew findings show that each human has on average 60 new mutations compared to their parentsApart from mutations many genes that may have aided humans in ancient times plague humans todayFor example it is suspected that genes that allow humans to more efficiently process food are those that make people susceptible to obesity and diabetes today

- - what was the main contribution of john maynard keynes made to economics
  - John Maynard Keynes 1st Baron Keynes CB  FBA   5 June 1883  21 April 1946 was a British economist whose ideas have fundamentally affected the theory and practice of modern macroeconomics  and informed the economic policies of governmentsHe built on and greatly refined earlier work on the causes of business cycles  and is widely considered to be one of the founders of modern macroeconomics and the most influential economist of the 20th centuryHis ideas are the basis for the school of thought known as Keynesian economics  as well as its various offshootsIn many ways subsequent developments in 20th century economics can be viewed as either building on Keynes ideas or reacting against themIn the 1930s Keynes spearheaded a revolution in economic thinking overturning the older ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would in the short to medium term automatically provide full employment as long as workers were flexible in their wage demandsKeynes instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment He advocated the use of fiscal and monetary measures to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions Following the outbreak of the Second World War  Keyness ideas concerning economic policy were adopted by leading Western economiesIn 1942 Keynes was awarded a hereditary peerage as Baron Keynes of Tilton in the County of SussexKeynes died in 1946 but during the 1950s and 1960s the success of Keynesian economics resulted in almost all capitalist governments adopting its policy recommendationsKeyness influence waned in the 1970s partly as a result of problems that began to afflict the AngloAmerican economies from the start of the decade and partly because of critiques from Milton Friedman and other economists who were pessimistic about the ability of governments to regulate the business cycle with fiscal policyHowever the advent of the global financial crisis in 2007 caused a resurgence in Keynesian thought Keynesian economics provided the theoretical underpinning for economic policies undertaken in response to the crisis by Presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama of the United States Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom and other heads of governmentsIn 1999 Time magazine included Keynes in their list of the 100 most important and influential people of the 20th century  commenting that His radical idea that governments should spend money they dont have may have saved capitalismIn addition to being an economist Keynes was also a civil servant a director of the British Eugenics Society  a director of the Bank of England  a patron of the arts and an art collector a part of the Bloomsbury Group of intellectuals an advisor to several charitable trusts a writer a philosopher a private investor and a farmer

- - when was the trogan war
  - In Greek mythology  the Trojan War was waged against the city of Troy by the Achaeans  Greeks  after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus king of Sparta The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of Greek literature  most notably through Homer s Iliad and the Odyssey The Iliad relates a part of the last year of the siege of Troy the Odyssey describes Odysseus s journey homeOther parts of the war are contained in a cycle of epic poems  which have survived through fragmentsEpisodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature and for Roman poets including Virgil and Ovid The war originated from a quarrel between the goddesses Athena  Hera  and Aphrodite  after Eris  the goddess of strife and discord gave them a golden apple  sometimes known as the Apple of Discord  marked for the fairestZeus sent the goddesses to Paris who judged that Aphrodite as the fairest should receive the appleIn exchange Aphrodite made Helen the most beautiful of all women and wife of Menelaus fall in love with Paris  who took her to TroyAgamemnon  king of Mycenae and the brother of Helens husband Menelaus  led an expedition of Achaean troops to Troy and besieged the city for ten years because of Paris insultAfter the deaths of many heroes including the Achaeans Achilles and Ajax  and the Trojans Hector and Paris the city fell to the ruse of the Trojan Horse The Achaeans slaughtered the Trojans except for some of the women and children whom they kept or sold as slaves and desecrated the temples thus earning the gods wrathFew of the Achaeans returned safely to their homes and many founded colonies in distant shoresThe Romans later traced their origin to Aeneas  one of the Trojans who was said to have led the surviving Trojans to modernday Italy The ancient Greeks thought that the Trojan War was a historical event that had taken place in the 13th or 12th century BC and believed that Troy was located in modernday Turkey near the Dardanelles By modern times both the war and the city were widely believed to be nonhistoricalIn 1868 however the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann met Frank Calvert  who convinced Schliemann that Troy was at Hissarlik and Schliemann took over Calverts excavations on property belonging to Calvert this claim is now accepted by most scholarsWhether there is any historical reality behind the Trojan War is an open questionMany scholars believe that there is a historical core to the tale though this may simply mean that the Homeric stories are a fusion of various tales of sieges and expeditions by Mycenaean Greeks during the Bronze Age Those who believe that the stories of the Trojan War are derived from a specific historical conflict usually date it to the 12th or 11th centuries BC often preferring the dates given by Eratosthenes  11941184 BC which roughly corresponds with archaeological evidence of a catastrophic burning of Troy VIIa

- - what is captcha code
  - Early CAPTCHAs such as these generated by the EZGimpy program were used on YahooA modern CAPTCHA rather than attempting to create a distorted background and high levels of warping on the text might focus on making segmentation difficult by adding an angled lineAnother way to make segmentation difficult is to crowd symbols together as in Yahoos current CAPTCHA formatSome CAPTCHAs try to utilize the ability of people to see threedimensional objectsOn this image symbols are drawn with lines of different thickness to make an effect of extrusionA CAPTCHA  is a type of challengeresponse test used in computing as an attempt to ensure that the response is generated by a human being The process usually involves a computer asking a user to complete a simple test which the computer is able to gradeThese tests are designed to be easy for a computer to generate but difficult for a computer to solve but again easy for a humanIf a correct solution is received it can be presumed to have been entered by a humanA common type of CAPTCHA requires the user to type letters andor digits from a distorted image that appears on the screenSuch tests are commonly used to prevent unwanted internet bots from accessing websites since a normal human can easily read a CAPTCHA while the bot cannot process the image letters and therefore cannot answer properly or at allAlthough most CAPTCHAs are letter pictures randomly generated many of them have become difficult even for a human to read  so picture CAPTCHAs were created in which a human is shown a simple test to show a picture of a certain animal given few animal pictures which is simple for a human being to process and therefore easy to pick while a bot cannot process and solve the question because although it can analyze the picture it cannot easily guess the animalThe term CAPTCHA was coined in 2000 by Luis von Ahn  Manuel Blum  Nicholas J Hopper  and John Langford all of Carnegie Mellon University It is an acronym based on the word capture and standing for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans ApartCarnegie Mellon University attempted to trademark the term on 15 October 2004 but the trademark application was abandoned on 21 April 2008A CAPTCHA is sometimes described as a reverse Turing test  because it is administered by a machine and targeted at a human in contrast to the standard Turing test that is typically administered by a human and targeted at a machine

- - what is phylum cnidaria
  - Cnidaria  with a silent c or Coelenterata is a phylum containing over 10000 species of animals found exclusively in aquatic and mostly marine environmentsTheir distinguishing feature is cnidocytes  specialized cells that they use mainly for capturing preyTheir bodies consist of mesoglea  a nonliving jellylike substance sandwiched between two layers of epithelium that are mostly one cell thick They have two basic body forms swimming medusae and sessile polyps  both of which are radially symmetrical with mouths surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytesBoth forms have a single orifice and body cavity that are used for digestion and respiration Many cnidarian species produce colonies that are single organisms composed of medusalike or polyplike zooids  or bothCnidarians activities are coordinated by a decentralized nerve net and simple receptorsSeveral freeswimming Cubozoa and Scyphozoa possess balancesensing statocysts  and some have simple eyesNot all cnidarians reproduce sexually Many have complex lifecycles with asexual polyp stages and sexual medusae but some omit either the polyp or the medusa stageCnidarians were for a long time grouped with Ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata  but increasing awareness of their differences caused them to be placed in separate phylaCnidarians are classified into four main groups the almost wholly sessile Anthozoa  sea anemones  corals  sea pens  swimming Scyphozoa jellyfish Cubozoa box jellies and Hydrozoa  a diverse group that includes all the freshwater cnidarians as well as many marine forms and has both sessile members such as Hydra and colonial swimmers such as the Portuguese Man o War Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a subgroup of Scyphozoa and there is debate about whether Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa are cnidarians or closer to bilaterians more complex animalsMost cnidarians prey on organisms ranging in size from plankton to animals several times larger than themselves but many obtain much of their nutrition from endosymbiotic algae  and a few are parasites Many are preyed upon by other animals including starfish  sea slugs  fish and turtles Coral reefs  whose polyps are rich in endosymbiotic algae support some of the worlds most productive ecosystems  and protect vegetation in tidal zones and on shorelines from strong currents and tidesWhile corals are almost entirely restricted to warm shallow marine waters other cnidarians live in the depths in polar seas and in freshwaterFossil cnidarians have been found in rocks formed about  and other fossils show that corals may have been present shortly before and diversified a few million years laterFossils of cnidarians that do not build mineralized structures are very rareScientists currently think that cnidarians ctenophores and bilaterians are more closely related to calcareous sponges than these are to other sponges  and that anthozoans are the evolutionary aunts or sisters of other cnidarians and the most closely related to bilateriansRecent analyses have concluded that cnidarians although considered more primitive than bilaterians have a wider range of genes

- - what is standard deviation in statistics
  - A plot of a normal distribution or bellshaped curve where each band has a width of 1 standard deviation  See also 6895997 ruleCumulative probability of a normal distribution with expected value 0 and standard deviation 1In statistics and probability theory  standard deviation represented by the symbol sigma   shows how much variation or dispersion exists from the average  mean  or expected valueA low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean  high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of valuesThe standard deviation of a random variable  statistical population  data set or probability distribution is the square root of its variance It is algebraically simpler though practically less robust than the average absolute deviation A useful property of standard deviation is that unlike variance it is expressed in the same units as the dataNote however that for measurements with percentage as unit the standard deviation will have percentage points as unitIn addition to expressing the variability of a population standard deviation is commonly used to measure confidence in statistical conclusionsFor example the margin of error in polling data is determined by calculating the expected standard deviation in the results if the same poll were to be conducted multiple timesThe reported margin of error is typically about twice the standard deviation  the radius of a 95 percent confidence interval In science researchers commonly report the standard deviation of experimental data and only effects that fall far outside the range of standard deviation are considered statistically significant  normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from causal variationStandard deviation is also important in finance where the standard deviation on the rate of return on an investment is a measure of the volatility of the investmentWhen only a sample of data from a population is available the standard deviation of the population can be estimated by a modified quantity called the sample standard deviationWhen the sample is the entire population its unmodified standard deviation is called the population standard deviation

- - where is the rosetta stone located in 2010
  - The Rosetta Stone in the British MuseumThe Rosetta Stone is an ancient Egyptian granodiorite stele inscribed with a decree issued at Memphis in 196 BC on behalf of King Ptolemy V The decree appears in three scripts the upper text is Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs  the middle portion Demotic script and the lowest Ancient Greek Because it presents essentially the same text in all three scripts with some minor differences between them it provided the key to the modern understanding of Egyptian hieroglyphs Originally displayed within a temple  the stone was probably moved during the early Christian or medieval period and eventually used as building material in the construction of Fort Julien near the town of Rashid Rosetta in the Nile Delta It was rediscovered there in 1799 by a soldier PierreFranois Bouchard  of the French expedition to Egypt As the first Ancient Egyptian bilingual text recovered in modern times the Rosetta Stone aroused widespread public interest with its potential to decipher this hitherto untranslated ancient languageLithographic copies and plaster casts began circulating among European museums and scholarsMeanwhile British troops defeated the French in Egypt in 1801 and the original stone came into British possession under the Capitulation of Alexandria Transported to London it has been on public display at the British Museum since 1802It is the mostvisited object in the British MuseumEver since its rediscovery the stone has been the focus of nationalist rivalries including its transfer from French to British possession during the Napoleonic Wars  a longrunning dispute over the relative value of Youngs and Champollions contributions to the decipherment and since 2003 demands for the stones return to EgyptStudy of the decree was already under way as the first full translation of the Greek text appeared in 1803It was 20 years however before the transliteration of the Egyptian scripts was announced by JeanFranois Champollion in Paris in 1822 it took longer still before scholars were able to read Ancient Egyptian inscriptions and literature confidentlyMajor advances in the decoding were recognition that the stone offered three versions of the same text 1799 that the demotic text used phonetic characters to spell foreign names 1802 that the hieroglyphic text did so as well and had pervasive similarities to the demotic  Thomas Young  1814 and that in addition to being used for foreign names phonetic characters were also used to spell native Egyptian words Champollion 18221824Two other fragmentary copies of the same decree were discovered later and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known including two slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees the Decree of Canopus in 238 BC and the Memphis decree of Ptolemy IV  ca 218 BCThe Rosetta Stone is therefore no longer unique but it was the essential key to modern understanding of Ancient Egyptian literature and civilization The term Rosetta Stone is now used in other contexts as the name for the essential clue to a new field of knowledge

- - What is the value of understanding crosscultural psychology
  - Crosscultural psychology is the scientific study of human behavior and mental processes including both their variability and invariance under diverse cultural conditionsThrough expanding research methodologies to recognize cultural variance in behavior language and meaning it seeks to extend and develop psychology Since psychology as an academic discipline was developed largely in North America some psychologists became concerned that constructs accepted as universal were not as invariant as previously assumed especially since many attempts to replicate notable experiments in other cultures had varying successSince there are questions as to whether theories dealing with central themes such as affect cognition  conceptions of the self and issues such as psychopathology anxiety and depression may lack external validity when exported to other cultural contexts crosscultural psychology reexamines them using methodologies designed to factor in cultural differences so as to account for cultural varianceAlthough some critics have pointed to methodological flaws in crosscultural psychological research and claim that serious shortcomings in the theoretical and methodological bases used impede rather than help the scientific search for universal principles in psychology crosscultural psychologists are turning more to the study of how differences variance occur rather than searching for universals in the style of physics or chemistryIn 1972 the International Association of CrossCultural Psychology IACCP was establishedThis branch of psychology has continued to expand as there has been an increasing popularity of incorporating culture and diversity into studiesCrosscultural psychology is differentiated from Cultural psychology The latter is the branch of psychology that holds that human behavior is significantly influenced by cultural differences meaning that psychological phenomena can only be compared with each other across cultures to a very limited extentIn contrast crosscultural psychology includes a search for possible universals in behavior and mental processesWalter J Lonner writing for Eye on Psi Chi has stated that crosscultural psychology can be thought of as a type research methodology rather than an entirely separate field within psychology 2000

- - what is darwins origin of species
  - On the Origin of Species published on 24 November 1859 is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology Its full title was On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for LifeFor the sixth edition of 1872 the short title was changed to The Origin of SpeciesDarwins book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection It presented a body of evidence that the diversity of life arose by common descent through a branching pattern of evolution Darwin included evidence that he had gathered on the Beagle expedition in the 1830s and his subsequent findings from research correspondence and experimentationVarious evolutionary ideas had already been proposed to explain new findings in biology There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public but during the first half of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England  while science was part of natural theology Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique unrelated to other animalsThe political and theological implications were intensely debated but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstreamThe book was written for nonspecialist readers and attracted widespread interest upon its publicationAs Darwin was an eminent scientist his findings were taken seriously and the evidence he presented generated scientific philosophical and religious discussionThe debate over the book contributed to the campaign by TH Huxley and his fellow members of the X Club to secularise science by promoting scientific naturalism Within two decades there was widespread scientific agreement that evolution with a branching pattern of common descent had occurred but scientists were slow to give natural selection the significance that Darwin thought appropriateDuring the  eclipse of Darwinism  from the 1880s to the 1930s various other mechanisms of evolution were given more creditWith the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s and 1940s Darwins concept of evolutionary adaptation through natural selection became central to modern evolutionary theory now the unifying concept of the life sciences

- - what is right to set off payments
  - In law  a setoff is a statutory defense to the whole or to a portion of a plaintiffs claimIt had no existence under the English common law  being created by 2 Geo II c 22 for the relief of insolvent debtors although setoff was recognized in equity Such a defense could be pleaded only in respect of mutual debts of a definite character and did not apply to cases in which damages were claimed nor to equitable claims or demandsBy the rules of the Supreme Court O XIX r 3 a defendant in an action may set off or set up any right or claim by way of counterclaim against the claims of a plaintiff and such setoff or counterclaim has the same effect as a statement of claim in a crossactionThe legal defense of setoff above was originally introduced to prevent the unfair situation whereby a person Party A who owed money to another Party B could be sent to debtors prison despite the fact that Party B also owed money to Party AThe law thus allows both parties to defer payment until their respective claims have been heard in courtUpon judgment both claims are extinguished and replaced by a single net sum owing eg If Party A owes Party B 100 and Party B owes Party A 105 the two sums are set off and replaced with a single obligation of 5 from Party B to Party ASetoff can also be incorporated by contractual agreement so that where a party defaults the mutual amounts owing are automatically set off and extinguishedIn certain jurisdictions including the UK setoff takes place automatically upon the insolvency of a companyThis means that for each party which is both a creditor and debtor of the insolvent company mutual debts are setoff against each other and then either the bankrupts creditor can claim the balance in the bankruptcy or the trustee in bankruptcy can ask for the balance remaining to be paid depending on which side owed the mostThis has been criticized as an undeclared security interest that violates the principle of pari passu The alternative where a creditor has to pay all its debts but receive only a limited portion of the leftover moneys that other unsecured creditors get poses the danger of knockon insolvenciesThe right to set off is particularly important when reporting a banks exposures to regulatory authoritiesThe situation where a bank has to report that it has lent a large sum to a borrower and is therefore exposed because there is a risk that the borrower might default thereby leading to the loss of the banks or its depositors money is thus replaced where the bank has taken security over shares or securities of the borrower with an exposure of the money lent minus the value of the security taken

  - Conventional PCI PCI is an initialism formed from Peripheral Component Interconnect part of the PCI Local Bus standard and often shortened to just PCI is a local computer bus for attaching hardware devices in a computer The PCI bus supports the functions found on a processor bus  but in a standardized format that is independent of any particular processorDevices connected to the bus appear to the processor to be connected directly to the processor bus and are assigned addresses in the processors address spaceAttached devices can take either the form of an integrated circuit fitted onto the motherboard itself called a planar device in the PCI specification or an expansion card that fits into a slotThe PCI Local Bus was first implemented in IBM PC compatibles  where it displaced the combination of ISA plus one VESA Local Bus as the bus configurationIt has subsequently been adopted for other computer typesPCI and PCIX are being replaced by PCI Express  but  most motherboards are still made with one or more PCI slots which are sufficient for many usesThe PCI specification covers the physical size of the bus including the size and spacing of the circuit board edge electrical contacts electrical characteristics bus timing and protocolsThe specification can be purchased from the PCI Special Interest Group PCISIGTypical PCI cards used in PCs include network cards  sound cards  modems  extra ports such as USB or serial  TV tuner cards and disk controllers PCI video cards replaced ISA and VESA cards until growing bandwidth requirements outgrew the capabilities of PCI the preferred interface for video cards became AGP  and then PCI ExpressPCI video cards remain available for use with old PCs without AGP or PCI Express slotsMany devices previously provided on PCI expansion cards are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in universal serial bus and PCI Express versions
- - what is in caffeine

- - when was mumpsvax administered in 1960
  - Example Polish call for vaccination against Diphtheria and Tetanus A vaccination schedule is a series of vaccinations  including the timing of all doses which may be either recommended or compulsory depending on the country of residenceA vaccine is an antigenic preparation used to produce active immunity to a disease  in order to prevent or reduce the effects of infection by any natural or wild pathogen Many vaccines require multiple doses for maximum effectiveness either to produce sufficient initial immune response or to boost response that fades over timeFor example tetanus vaccine boosters are often recommended every 10 yearsVaccine schedules are developed by governmental agencies or physicians groups to achieve maximum effectiveness using required and recommended vaccines for a locality while minimizing the number of health care system interactionsOver the past two decades the recommended vaccination schedule has grown rapidly and become more complicated as many new vaccines have been developedSome vaccines are recommended only in certain areas countries subnational areas or atrisk populations where a disease is commonFor instance yellow fever vaccination is on the routine vaccine schedule of French Guiana is recommended in certain regions of Brazil but in the United States is only given to travelers heading to countries with a history of the diseaseIn developing countries vaccine recommendations also take into account the level of health care access the cost of vaccines and issues with vaccine availability and storageSample vaccinations schedules discussed by the World Health Organization show a developed country using a schedule which extends over the first five years of a childs life and uses vaccines which cost over 700 including administration costs while a developing country uses a schedule providing vaccines in the first 9 months of life and costing only 25This difference is due to the lower cost of health care the lower cost of many vaccines provided to developing nations and that more expensive vaccines often for less common diseases are not utilizedIn 1900 the smallpox vaccine was the only one administered to childrenBy the early 1950s children routinely received four vaccines for protection against  diphtheria  pertussis  tetanus  polio  and smallpox  and as many as five shots by two years of ageSince the mid1980s many vaccines have been added to the schedule the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC now recommends vaccination against at least fourteen diseasesBy two years of age US children receive as many as 24 vaccine injections and might receive up to five shots during one visit to the doctorThe use of combination vaccine products means that  the United Kingdom s immunization program consists of 10 injections by the age of two rather than 25 if vaccination for each disease was given as a separate injection

- - what is the purpose of vitamin d
  - Vitamin D is a group of fatsoluble secosteroids responsible for intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphateIn humans the most important related compounds of vitamin D are vitamin D2 and vitamin D3Cholecalciferol vitamin D3 and ergocalciferol vitamin D2 are unique as they constitute what we know as vitamin D and can be ingested from the diet andor supplementsThe body can also synthesize vitamin D from cholesterol when sun exposure is adequate hence its nickname the sunshine vitaminAlthough vitamin D is commonly called a vitamin it is not actually an essential dietary vitamin in the strict sense as it can be synthesized in adequate amounts by most mammals exposed to sunlightCats and dogs cannot synthesize vitamin D efficiently and must receive it in their dietAn organic chemical compound or related set of compounds is only scientifically called a vitamin when it cannot be synthesized in sufficient quantities by an organism and must be obtained from their dietHowever as with other compounds commonly called vitamins vitamin D was discovered in an effort to find the dietary substance that was lacking in a disease namely rickets  the childhood form of osteomalacia Additionally like other compounds called vitamins in the developed world vitamin D is added to staple foods such as milk to avoid disease due to deficiencyMeasures of serum levels reflect endogenous synthesis from exposure to sunlight as well as intake from the diet and it is believed that synthesis may contribute generally to the maintenance of adequate serum concentrationsThe evidence indicates that the synthesis of vitamin D from sun exposure works in a feedback loop that prevents toxicity but because of uncertainty about the cancer risk from sunlight no recommendations are issued by the Institute of Medicine  USA for the amount of sun exposure required to meet vitamin D requirementsAccordingly the Dietary Reference Intakes for vitamin D assume that no synthesis occurs and that all of a persons vitamin D is from their diet although that will rarely occur in practiceIn the liver vitamin D is converted to calcidiol  which is also known as calcifediol INN 25hydroxycholecalciferol or 25hydroxyvitamin Dabbreviated 25OHD and which is the specific vitamin D metabolite that is measured in serum to determine a persons vitamin D statusPart of the calcidiol is converted by the kidneys to calcitriol  the biologically active form of vitamin D Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood regulating the concentration of calcium and phosphate in the bloodstream and promoting the healthy growth and remodeling of boneCalcidiol is also converted to calcitriol outside of the kidneys for other purposes such as the proliferation differentiation and apoptosis of cells calcitriol also affects neuromuscular function and inflammationBeyond its use to prevent osteomalacia or rickets  the evidence for other health effects of vitamin D supplementation in the general population is inconsistentThe best evidence of benefit is for bone health and a decrease in mortality in elderly women
- - what is an element on a periodic table
  - Standard form of the periodic tableThe colors represent different categories of elements explained belowThe periodic table is a tabular display of the chemical elements  organized on the basis of their atomic numbers  electron configurations  and recurring chemical properties Elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number number of protonsThe standard form of table comprises an 18  7 grid or main body of elements positioned above a smaller double row of elementsThe table can also be deconstructed into four rectangular blocks the sblock to the left the pblock to the right the dblock in the middle and the fblock below thatThe rows of the table are called periods  the columns of the s d and pblocks are called groups  with some of these having names such as the halogens or the noble gases Since by definition a periodic table incorporates recurring trends  any such table can be used to derive relationships between the properties of the elements and predict the properties of new yet to be discovered or synthesized elementsAs a result a periodic tablewhether in the standard form or some other variantprovides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior and such tables are widely used in chemistry and other sciencesAlthough precursors exist Dmitri Mendeleev is generally credited with the publication in 1869 of the first widely recognized periodic tableHe developed his table to illustrate periodic trends in the properties of the thenknown elementsMendeleev also predicted some properties of thenunknown elements that would be expected to fill gaps in this tableMost of his predictions were proved correct when the elements in question were subsequently discoveredMendeleevs periodic table has since been expanded and refined with the discovery or synthesis of further new elements and the development of new theoretical models to explain chemical behaviorAll elements from atomic numbers 1  hydrogen  to 118  ununoctium  have been discovered or synthesizedThe elements from 1 to 98  californium  have been found to exist naturally although some are found only in trace amounts and were initially discovered by synthesis in laboratoriesThe elements after 98 have only been synthesized in laboratoriesProduction of elements beyond ununoctium is being pursued with the question of how the periodic table may need to be modified to accommodate any such additions being a matter of ongoing debateNumerous synthetic radionuclides of naturally occurring elements have also been produced in laboratories

  - Acoustic coupler modemA modem modulatordemodulator is a device that modulates an analog carrier signal to encode digital information  and also demodulates such a carrier signal to decode the transmitted informationThe goal is to produce a signal that can be transmitted easily and decoded to reproduce the original digital dataModems can be used over any means of transmitting analog signals from light emitting diodes to radio The most familiar example is a voice band modem that turns the digital data of a personal computer into modulated electrical signals in the voice frequency range of a telephone channelThese signals can be transmitted over telephone lines and demodulated by another modem at the receiver side to recover the digital dataModems are generally classified by the amount of data they can send in a given unit of time  usually expressed in bits per second bits or bps or bytes per second BsModems can alternatively be classified by their symbol rate  measured in baud The baud unit denotes symbols per second or the number of times per second the modem sends a new signalFor example the ITU V21 standard used audio frequency shift keying with two possible frequencies corresponding to two distinct symbols or one bit per symbol to carry 300 bits per second using 300 baudBy contrast the original ITU V22 standard which was able to transmit and receive four distinct symbols two bits per symbol handled 1200 bits by sending 600 symbols per second 600 baud using phase shift keying

- - what was the Germans last offensive on the western Front during World war 2
  - Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914 the German Army opened the Western Front by first invading Luxembourg and Belgium  then gaining military control of important industrial regions in France The tide of the advance was dramatically turned with the Battle of the Marne Following the race to the sea  both sides dug in along a meandering line of fortified trenches  stretching from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier with FranceThis line remained essentially unchanged for most of the warBetween 1915 and 1917 there were several major offensives along this front The attacks employed massive artillery bombardments and massed infantry advancesHowever a combination of entrenchments machine gun nests barbed wire  and artillery repeatedly inflicted severe casualties on the attackers and counterattacking defendersAs a result no significant advances were madeAmong the most costly of these offensives were the Battle of Verdun with a combined estimated 700000 dead the Battle of the Somme with more than an estimated million casualties and the Battle of Passchendaele with roughly an estimated 600000 casualtiesIn an effort to break the deadlock this front saw the introduction of new military technology  including poison gas  aircraft and tanks But it was only after the adoption of improved tactics that some degree of mobility was restoredThe German Spring Offensive of 1918 was made possible by the Treaty of BrestLitovsk that marked the end of the conflict on the Eastern Front Using the recentlyintroduced infiltration tactics  the German armies advanced nearly to the west which marked the deepest advance by either side since 1914 and very nearly succeeded in forcing a breakthroughIn spite of the generally stagnant nature of this front this theater would prove decisiveThe inexorable advance of the Allied armies during the second half of 1918 persuaded the German commanders that defeat was inevitable and the government was forced to sue for conditions of an armisticeThe terms of peace were agreed upon with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919
