- - what happened on the moon during the period of Late Heavy Bombardment
  - The Late Heavy Bombardment commonly referred to as the lunar cataclysm or LHB is a hypothetical event around 41 to 38 billion years ago  Ga During this event a very large number of the impact craters on the Moon would have formed and by inference on Earth  Mercury  Venus and Mars as wellWhile the LHB is late in the Solar Systems accretion period when Earth and the other rocky planets formed and gained most of their mass it is early in Solar System historyThe evidence for this event comes primarily from the dating of lunar samples brought back by the Apollo astronauts which indicates that most impact melt rocks formed in this rather narrow interval of timeWhile many hypotheses have been put forth to explain a spike in the flux of asteroids or comets in the inner Solar System at this time no consensus yet exists as to its causeThe Nice model  popular among planetary scientists  postulates that the gas giant planets underwent orbital migration and forced objects in the asteroid belt andor Kuiper belt on eccentric orbits that put them in the path of the terrestrial planets Nevertheless some researchers argue that the lunar sample data do not require a cataclysmic cratering event near 39 Ga and that the apparent clustering of impact melt ages near this time is an artifact of sampling material affected by a single large impact basinArtists impression of the moon during the Late Heavy Bombardment Lunar Cataclysm and today

  - The Federal Reserve System also known as the Federal Reserve and informally as the Fed is the central banking system of the United StatesIt was created on December 23 1913 with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act  largely in response to a series of financial panics particularly a severe panic in 1907 Over time the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System have expanded and its structure has evolvedEvents such as the Great Depression were major factors leading to changes in the systemThe US Congress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act Maximum employment stable prices and moderate longterm interest ratesThe first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserves dual mandateIts duties have expanded over the years and today according to official Federal Reserve documentation include conducting the nations monetary policy  supervising and regulating banking institutions maintaining the stability of the financial system and providing financial services to depository institutions  the US government and foreign official institutionsThe Fed also conducts research into the economy and releases numerous publications such as the Beige Book The Federal Reserve Systems structure is composed of the presidentially appointed Board of Governors or Federal Reserve Board the Federal Open Market Committee FOMC twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks located in major cities throughout the nation numerous privately owned US member banks and various advisory councilsThe FOMC is the committee responsible for setting monetary policy and consists of all seven members of the Board of Governors and the twelve regional bank presidents though only five bank presidents vote at any given time the president of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through oneyear termsThe Federal Reserve System has both private and public components and was designed to serve the interests of both the general public and private bankersThe result is a structure that is considered unique among central banksIt is also unusual in that an entity outside of the central bank namely the United States Department of the Treasury  creates the currency usedAccording to the Board of Governors the Federal Reserve System is considered an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional termsThe authority of the Federal Reserve System is derived from statutes enacted by the US Congress and the System is subject to congressional oversightThe members of the Board of Governors including its chairman and vicechairman are chosen by the President and confirmed by the SenateThe government also exercises some control over the Federal Reserve by appointing and setting the salaries of the systems highestlevel employeesNationally chartered commercial banks are required to hold stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of their region this entitles them to elect some of the members of the board of the regional Federal Reserve BankThus the Federal Reserve system has both public and private aspectsThe US Government receives all of the systems annual profits after a statutory dividend of 6 on member banks capital investment is paid and an account surplus is maintainedIn 2010 the Federal Reserve made a profit of 82 billion and transferred 79 billion to the US Treasury This was followed at the end of 2011 with a transfer of 77 billion in profits to the US Treasury Department

- - how do people get color blindness
  - Color blindness or color vision deficiency is the inability or decreased ability to see color  or perceive color differences under normal lighting conditionsColor blindness affects a significant percentage of the populationThere is no actual blindness but there is a deficiency of color visionThe most usual cause is a fault in the development of one or more sets of retinal cones that perceive color in light and transmit that information to the optic nerveThis type of color blindness is usually a sexlinked conditionThe genes that produce photopigments are carried on the X chromosome if some of these genes are missing or damaged color blindness will be expressed in males with a higher probability than in females because males only have one X chromosome in females a functional gene on only one of the two X chromosomes is sufficient to yield the needed photopigmentsColor blindness can also be produced by physical or chemical damage to the eye the optic nerve  or parts of the brainFor example people with achromatopsia suffer from a completely different disorder but are nevertheless unable to see colorsThe English chemist John Dalton published the first scientific paper on this subject in 1798 Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours after the realization of his own color blindnessBecause of Daltons work the general condition has been called daltonism although in English this term is now used more narrowly for deuteranopia aloneColor blindness is usually classified as a mild disability however there are occasional circumstances where it can give an advantageSome studies conclude that color blind people are better at penetrating certain color camouflagesSuch findings may give an evolutionary reason for the high prevalence of redgreen color blindnessAnd there is also a study suggesting that people with some types of color blindness can distinguish colors that people with normal color vision are not able to distinguish

- - how much mercury is in a thermometer
  - Closeup of a maximum thermometerThe break in the column of mercury is visibleThe mercuryinglass or mercury thermometer was invented by German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit in 1714It consists of a bulb containing mercury attached to a glass tube of narrow diameter the volume of mercury in the tube is much less than the volume in the bulbThe volume of mercury changes slightly with temperature the small change in volume drives the narrow mercury column a relatively long way up the tubeThe space above the mercury may be filled with nitrogen or it may be at less than atmospheric pressure  a partial vacuum In order to calibrate the thermometer the bulb is made to reach thermal equilibrium with a temperature standard such as an icewater mixture and then with another standard such as watervapour and the tube is divided into regular intervals between the fixed pointsIn principle thermometers made of different material eg coloured alcohol might be expected to give different intermediate readings due to different expansion properties in practice the substances used are chosen to have reasonably linear expansion characteristics as a function of true thermodynamic temperature  and so give similar results

  - In Greek mythology  the Trojan War was waged against the city of Troy by the Achaeans  Greeks  after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus king of Sparta The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of Greek literature  most notably through Homer s Iliad and the Odyssey The Iliad relates a part of the last year of the siege of Troy the Odyssey describes Odysseus s journey homeOther parts of the war are contained in a cycle of epic poems  which have survived through fragmentsEpisodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature and for Roman poets including Virgil and Ovid The war originated from a quarrel between the goddesses Athena  Hera  and Aphrodite  after Eris  the goddess of strife and discord gave them a golden apple  sometimes known as the Apple of Discord  marked for the fairestZeus sent the goddesses to Paris who judged that Aphrodite as the fairest should receive the appleIn exchange Aphrodite made Helen the most beautiful of all women and wife of Menelaus fall in love with Paris  who took her to TroyAgamemnon  king of Mycenae and the brother of Helens husband Menelaus  led an expedition of Achaean troops to Troy and besieged the city for ten years because of Paris insultAfter the deaths of many heroes including the Achaeans Achilles and Ajax  and the Trojans Hector and Paris the city fell to the ruse of the Trojan Horse The Achaeans slaughtered the Trojans except for some of the women and children whom they kept or sold as slaves and desecrated the temples thus earning the gods wrathFew of the Achaeans returned safely to their homes and many founded colonies in distant shoresThe Romans later traced their origin to Aeneas  one of the Trojans who was said to have led the surviving Trojans to modernday Italy The ancient Greeks thought that the Trojan War was a historical event that had taken place in the 13th or 12th century BC and believed that Troy was located in modernday Turkey near the Dardanelles By modern times both the war and the city were widely believed to be nonhistoricalIn 1868 however the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann met Frank Calvert  who convinced Schliemann that Troy was at Hissarlik and Schliemann took over Calverts excavations on property belonging to Calvert this claim is now accepted by most scholarsWhether there is any historical reality behind the Trojan War is an open questionMany scholars believe that there is a historical core to the tale though this may simply mean that the Homeric stories are a fusion of various tales of sieges and expeditions by Mycenaean Greeks during the Bronze Age Those who believe that the stories of the Trojan War are derived from a specific historical conflict usually date it to the 12th or 11th centuries BC often preferring the dates given by Eratosthenes  11941184 BC which roughly corresponds with archaeological evidence of a catastrophic burning of Troy VIIa

- - who had the social contract theory
  - In political philosophy the social contract or political contract is a theory or model originating during the Age of Enlightenment  that typically addresses the questions of the origin of society and the legitimacy of the authority of the state over the individual Social contract arguments typically posit that individuals have consented either explicitly or tacitly to surrender some of their freedoms and submit to the authority of the ruler or magistrate or to the decision of a majority in exchange for protection of their remaining rights The question of the relation between natural and legal rights  therefore is often an aspect of social contract theoryAlthough the antecedents of social contract theory are found in antiquity in Greek and Stoic philosophy and Roman and Canon Law  as well as in the Biblical idea of the covenant  the heyday of the social contract was the midseventeenth to early nineteenth centuries when it emerged as the leading doctrine of political legitimacyThe starting point for most social contract theories is a heuristic examination of the human condition absent from any political order that Thomas Hobbes termed the  state of nature In this condition individuals actions are bound only by their personal power and conscience From this shared starting point social contract theorists seek to demonstrate in different ways why a rational individual would voluntarily consent to give up his or her natural freedom to obtain the benefits of political orderHugo Grotius 1625 Thomas Hobbes 1651 Samuel Pufendorf 1673 John Locke 1689 JeanJacques Rousseau 1762 and Immanuel Kant 1797 are among the most prominent of seventeenth and eighteenthcentury theorists of social contract and natural rightsEach solved the problem of political authority in a different wayGrotius posited that individual human beings had natural rights  Hobbes asserted that men consent to abdicate their rights in favor of the absolute authority of government whether monarchial or parliamentary Pufendorf disputed Hobbess equation of a state of nature with warLocke believed that natural rights were inalienable and that the rule of God therefore superseded government authority and Rousseau believed that democracy selfrule was the best way of ensuring the general welfare while maintaining individual freedom under the rule of lawThe Lockean concept of the social contract was invoked in the United States Declaration of Independence Social contract theories were eclipsed in the nineteenth century in favor of utilitarianism  Hegelianism  and Marxism  and were revived in the twentieth notably in the form of a thought experiment by John Rawls

- - what is an NM
